# Patriarchy

Social system that privileges the male

Properties:

- Not primordial, but a social construct
- Defines gender expectations
	- Men also expected to conform to patriarchy
	- Homophobia & transphobia
- Generally, more civilized = fewer rights for women
  Greater economic independence = greater freedom and autonomy
  Higher caste / class = less freedom and autonomy
	- <= lowering of marriage age of girls
	- <= when a family can afford keeping women at home, its status rises. Conversely when economic situation improves, women are kept at home.
	- `E.g.` dvija women are more restricted.
	- `E.g.` adivasis are more egalitarian.

## Origins

1. Hunter-gatherer groups
	- Gender division of labour: women gather; men hunt
		- <= women reproduce so are less suitable for hunt
	- Gender balance
		- Women may be more respected because they have stable source of food.
2. Agricultural revolution
	- Gender division of labour: women spend more time inside; men spend more time outside
		- <= need to have more babies for population growth
3. Emergence of patriarchy
	- <= need to have more babies for population growth
	- <= accumulation of properties
	- <= public / private divide
4. Institutionalization
	- Religion, culture, laws, etc.

## Status of women

Affected by:

- Caste / class
- Region
	- Generally women in southern South Asia and rural areas have more freedom.
- Age
	- Older = higher status

### Honour / shame

Family is honoured if women behave in appropriate ways.

### Public / private spheres

Segregation of women

- *Public* sphere (*outside* the home): *men* space
	- Work deemed *more* important => *higher* male status
- *Private* sphere (*inside* the home): *women* space
	- Work deemed *less* important => *lower* female status

> [!example] Purdah (`lit.` curtain, veiling of women)

> [!example] Zenana (female apartments in a house)

### Protection / control

To protect honour, women are protected / controlled.

> [!example] Some women cannot leave the house without male escort.

## Preference for boys

Caused by:

- Patrilineality:
	- Lineage
	- Property transfer
- Patrilocality:
	- Care of parents in old age
- Funeral rituals performed by sons
- Dowry

## Concepts

### Patrilineality

In a family, inheritance of properties by the male line

### Patrilocality

Cultural pattern where married couple settles in the husband's home or community

## In [[South Asia]]

Variety of gender norms before patriarchy:

- Traditions of cross-dressing, transgender and transsexuality
- Ardhnarisvara

### Contestation

- Women going out of purdah:
	- *Women anti-colonialists* protested along with men anti-colonialists.
	- *Sarala devi Chaudhurani* founded the first national-level women's organisation in India.
	- *Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain* founded schools for girls and wrote Sultana's Dream, a feminist utopic story.
	- *Writing with Fire* documents a dalit female journalist who challenges gender and caste expectations.
- *Ring the doorbell* movement fights against domestic violence.
- *Burka Avenger* and *Meena* promote gender equality to kids.
