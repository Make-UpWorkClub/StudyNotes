# Siddhartha Gautama

Prince in Kapilavastu (Nepal)
Founder of [[Buddhism]]
A.k.a. Buddha

He grew up never leaving his palace. One day, he went outside and discovered suffering. He decided to leave the palace in search of the reason of human suffering, leaving behind his wife and his son. He practised severe austerity and nearly died, then realized it will not lead him to enlightenment and adopted the **Middle Way**. When meditating under the Bodhi tree by the Neranjara river, he achieved enlightenment.
