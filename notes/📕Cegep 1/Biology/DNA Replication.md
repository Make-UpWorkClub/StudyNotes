# DNA Replication

Process during [[Interphase#S|S phase]] in which [[Nucleic Acid#Deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]] makes a copy of itself
**Semiconservative** (one original strand is preserved in each copy)

## Enzymes

- **Helicase**: enzyme that unwinds DNA strands by breaking H-bonds
- [[Polymerase#DNA polymerase|DNA polymerase]]
- [[Polymerase#Primase|Primase]]
- **Ligase**: enzyme that repairs phosphodiester bonds

## Steps

### Initiation

1. Helicases bind to origins of replication and begin unwinding DNA to form a **replication bubble** with two **replication forks**, each fork with two strands.
2. Single-stranded binding proteins bind to the template DNA to keep them separated.

### Elongation

Synthesis of the complementary strands

Different for the two strands

#### Leading strand

*5' to 3' continuous* DNA synthesis in the *same* direction of DNA unwinding
*One* RNA primer

1. Primase makes a complementary RNA primer.
2. DNA polymerase binds to the RNA primer and makes new strand.
3. DNA polymerase replaces the RNA primer with DNA.
4. Ligase repairs link between replaced primer and rest of strand.

#### Lagging strand

*3' to 5' discontinuous* DNA synthesis in the *opposite* direction of DNA unwinding
*Many* RNA primers

1. Primase makes a complementary RNA primer
2. DNA polymerase binds to
