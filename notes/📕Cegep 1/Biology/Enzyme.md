# Enzyme

Biological catalyst
Protein or RNA

Hyper-specialized, unlike inorganic catalysts
Enzyme + substrates -> enzyme-substrate complex -> enzyme + products

> [!abstract] Substrate
> Substance on which an enzyme acts

> [!abstract] Active site
> Pocket or groove of an enzyme where the substrate binds **via weak bonds such as H-bonds and ionic bonds**

> [!abstract] Induced fit
> Change in the shape of an enzyme to fit the substrate

> [!abstract] Cofactor
> 1. Molecule that binds to certain enzymes to give them the right shape
> 2. Metallic ion cofactor that loosely binds to an enzyme

> [!abstract] Coenzyme
> Organic cofactor that loosely binds to an enzyme

> [!abstract] Apoenzyme
> Enzyme *without* required coenzyme
> Functions ineffectively or not at all

> [!abstract] Holoenzyme
> Enzyme *with* required coenzyme
> A.k.a. active enzyme

## Mechanics

- Ensure substrates collide in the correct orientation
- Stress bonds so that they break more easily
- Change local environment to favour the reaction, e.g. different pH
- Active site side chains can participate directly in the reaction

## Factors affecting reaction rate

- Temperature
- pH
- Enzyme concentration
- Cofactor concentration
- Substrate concentration
- Inhibitor type and concentration if present

## Inhibition

Process of preventing an enzyme from working

> [!abstract] Negative feedback inhibition
> Mechanism where the final product inhibits one of its enzymes
> Naturally maintains the amount of product at a certain level

### Reversibility

- Irreversible: inhibitor attaches by a *covalent* bond
	- Dangerous
	- > [!example] Nerve gas, penicillin, some poisons
- Reversible: inhibitor attaches by a *weak* bond
	- Important for regulating metabolism
	- > [!example] ATP inhibits PFK, which slows down cellular respiration.

> [!info] All biological inhibitors are reversible

### Competitiveness

- Competitive: binds to the *active site*
	- *Competes* with substrates => *affected* by substrate concentration
- Non-competitive: binds *somewhere else* on the enzyme, causing it to change shape
	- *Doesn't compete* with substrates => *unaffected* by substrate concentration
