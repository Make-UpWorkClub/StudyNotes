# Polymerase

[[Enzyme]] that synthesizes [[nucleic acid]] from precursors

## DNA polymerase

Enzyme that synthesizes the complementary DNA strand of a template DNA strand by catalyzing the formation of phosphodiester bonds
Makes the complementary strand from *5'* to *3'*
Reads the template strand from *3'* to *5'*

### Taq polymerase

Thermostable DNA polymerase that synthesizes DNA from deoxynucleoside triphosphates (`abbr.` dNTPs)

## RNA polymerase

Enzyme that synthesizes RNA

### Primase

RNA polymerase that synthesizes RNA primers on the template DNA strand
