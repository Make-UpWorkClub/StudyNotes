# Membrane

Outer layer of a [[cell]] or of an [[organelle]] made of a [[lipid]] bilayer
Selectively permeable

> [!abstract]+ Lipid bilayer
> Double layer of mainly phospholipid, also cholesterol, glycolipid molecules (incl. fat) and proteins
> Hydrophilic heads form the surfaces, hydrophobic tails form the core
> 
> *Unsaturated* hydrocarbon tails *increase* fluidity by *preventing* packing.
> *Saturated* hydrocarbon tails *decrease* fluidity by *favouring* packing.
> 
> ![[Unsaturated vs saturated hydrocarbon tails in lipid bilayer.png]]
> 
> At *moderate* temperature, cholesterol *decreases* fluidity by reducing lipid movement.
> At *low* temperature, cholesterol *increases* fluidity by preventing solidification.

## Associated proteins

### Integral protein

Protein that *penetrates* the membrane

#### Transmembrane protein

Integral protein that extends through the membrane (instead of partway)

Types:

- Channel: has a hydrophilic channel to transport hydrophiles
- Carrier: like channel, but also has binding sites for active transport

### Peripheral protein

Protein that *loosely associates to* the surface of the membrane

## Transport across membrane

Depends on type and size of molecule and fluidity of the membrane

### Passive transport

Moves solute *down* its concentration gradient (from higher concentration to lower concentration)

*Doesn't require* energy

#### Diffusion

For *hydrophobes*

#### Facilitated diffusion

Variant of diffusion
For *large polar molecules* (e.g. glucose) or *ions*

Requires *channel or carrier* protein

#### Osmosis

Special case of facilitated diffusion
For *water*, which moves against the concentration gradient of solute (a.k.a. down its concentration gradient)

Requires *aquaporin* protein

Continues until the two sides are isotonic

> [!abstract] Aquaporin
> Channel protein for osmosis

### Active transport

Moves solute *against* its concentration gradient (from lower concentration to higher concentration) **in exchange for another solute**

Requires *carrier* protein
*Requires* energy provided by the hydrolysis of ATP

Steps:

1. Solute 1 in solution 1 binds to the carrier
2. The carrier switches sides with energy provided by the hydrolysis of ATP
3. Solute 1 enters solution 2
4. Solute 2 in solution 2 (most commonly $K^+$) binds to the carrier
5. The carrier switches sides
6. Solute 2 enters solution 1
