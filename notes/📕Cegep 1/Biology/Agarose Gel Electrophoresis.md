# Agarose Gel Electrophoresis

Method of gel electrophoresis using agarose to separate DNA fragments

DNA mixture is poured into wells near the *cathode*. An electric current is run through the gel. DNA, being *negatively* charged due to phosphate, is attracted to the *anode*. Shorter DNA fragments travel further, thus separating them.
