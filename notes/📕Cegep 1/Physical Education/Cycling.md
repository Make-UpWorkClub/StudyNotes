## Preparation

- Good sleep
- Material
	- Helmet
	- Water bottle
	- Snack
	- Contact details
	- At night:
		- Reflective bright clothing
		- Front and rear lights
	- If leader or riding alone:
		- Tire patch kit

## Stance

|            | Standing | Sitting |
|:----------:|:--------:|:-------:|
|   Power    |    +     |    -    |
|  Cadence   |    -     |    +    |
| Heart rate |    +     |    -    |

## Tips

- Maintain a safe distance (1-2 bikes) with the bike in front
	- Increase distance when downhill
	- Avoid half wheeling
- Maintain a cadence of 70-90 rpm
- When turning:
	- Lean towards the turn
	- Inside pedal up, outside pedal down
- Break gently with both brake levers
	- Downshift in advance
- Watch out for:
	- Potholes, sewers, glass shards, railroad tracks, etc.
		- If unavoidable, stand on pedals without slowing down
	- Obstacles
	- Cars with people inside
		- They might suddenly open the door

> [!abstract] Half wheeling
> Dangerous move of overlapping the front wheel with the rear wheel of the bike in front

### [[Bicycle#Gears|Gear]] shifting

- Downshift when:
	- Going uphills
	- Wind is blowing from ahead
	- Braking
- Upshift when:
	- Going downhills
	- Wind is blowing from behind
	- Starting
- Ease on the pedals
	- Otherwise the chain may skip or fall off
- Avoid cross-chaining

> [!abstract] Cross-Chaining
> Mistake of putting the chain at an extreme slant by using big / small chainring with small / big gear, which stresses the chain

### Navigating intersections

- At red lights and stop signs, claim the lane
	- Prevent unsafe overtaking
- When travelling *straight*:
	- In a single lane intersection, claim the lane
		- Cars turning right don't expect bikes to their right
	- In a multi lane intersection, stay in the rightmost through lane, never enter the right turn lane
		- See above
	- If behind a truck, stay on the left side of the lane
		- Increase visibility to incoming cars
- When turning *left*, switch to the leftmost lane and claim the lane
	- Cut across as few lanes as possible
