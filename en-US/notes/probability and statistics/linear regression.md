# Linear Regression

Line that best describes a scatter plot with linear trend
Valid when dependent variable is quantitative and independent variable is either quantitative or binary

**True** linear regression equation:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x
$$

**Estimated** linear regression equation:

$$
\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x
$$

> [!warning] Can only estimate the dependent variable in the range

> [!warning] Significance != efficiency

> [!abstract] Residual
> Difference between y predicted by linear regression and observed y
