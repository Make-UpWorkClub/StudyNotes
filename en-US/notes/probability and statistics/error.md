# Error

Error in the conclusion of a [[test]]

## Types

### I

Incorrect acceptance of the *alternative* hypothesis
`Sym.` $P = \alpha$

### II

Incorrect acceptance of the *null* hypothesis
`Sym.` $P = \beta$

> [!info] Instead of accepting $H_0$, conclude that there's not enough evidence to reject $H_0$ to avoid $\beta$.
