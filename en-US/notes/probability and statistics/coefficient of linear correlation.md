# Coefficient of Linear Correlation

Measure of intensity of linear relationship between two variables
Ratio of [[covariance]] to the product of [[standard deviation|standard deviations]]
`Syn.` Pearson's correlation coefficient

*Sample* coefficient of linear correlation:

$$
r(X, Y) = \frac{Cov(X, Y)}{s_X, s_Y}
$$

*Population* coefficient of linear correlation:

$$
\rho(X, Y) = \frac{Cov(X, Y)}{\sigma_X, \sigma_Y}
$$

## Properties

- $-1 \le \rho(X, Y) \le 1$
- If $Y = aX + b$, then $\rho(X, Y) = \mathrm{sign}(a)$
