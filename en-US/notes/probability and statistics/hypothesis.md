# Hypothesis

In statistics, statement about the numerical value of a population parameter

## Types

### Null hypothesis

Hypothesis assumed to be true *unless* the data provides convincing evidence that it is *false*
Usually represents the *status quo*
`Sym.` $H_0$

Must *contain* equality *($\ge, \le, =$)*

### Alternative hypothesis

Hypothesis assumed to be true *only if* the data provides convincing evidence that it is *true*
Usually represents the *challenging view* the researcher tries to support
`Sym.` $H_1$ or $H_a$

Must *not contain* equality *($>, <, \ne$)*

## Examples

> From the city's perspective regarding whether a pipe meets the minimum breaking strength of 2400, state $H_0$ and $H_1$.

$$
\begin{align}
H_0: \mu \le 2400 \\
H_1: \mu > 2400
\end{align}
$$
