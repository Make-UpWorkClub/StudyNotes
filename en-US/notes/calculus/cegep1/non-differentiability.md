# Non-Differentiability

Quality of a function that is not [[differentiability|differentiable]] at a point or over an interval

A function is non-differentiable at a point $a$ when it is:

- Discontinuous
- A sharp corner, i.e. the derivative is discontinuous at $a$
- A **cusp** ($f'(a) = \infty$), e.g. $f'(0)$ of $f(x) = \sqrt[3]{ x }$
