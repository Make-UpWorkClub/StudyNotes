It activates the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, traps, and rear deltoids, along with engaging the biceps and core for stabilization.

4. With palms facing inwards, pull the dumbbells towards your hips, keeping your elbows close to your body.
5. Focus on driving your elbows back and squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
6. Lower the dumbbells slowly, maintaining control, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
