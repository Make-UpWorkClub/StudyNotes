# Body Weight Incline Push Up

![](https://croppio.com/images/exercises/resized/Body%20Weight%20Incline%20Push%20Up.webp)

## Description of Body Weight Incline Push Up

The Body Weight Incline Push Up is a dynamic upper body exercise that targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps while also engaging the core. This variation of the traditional push-up places your hands on an elevated surface, making it slightly easier than standard push-ups, making it an excellent choice for beginners or those looking to improve their overall pushing strength. The incline helps emphasize the lower chest and shoulders, resulting in balanced muscle development.

## Muscles Involved

- Pectoralis Major (Chest)
- Triceps Brachii (Back of the upper arm)
- Deltoids (Shoulders)
- Serratus Anterior (Lateral chest)
- Core Muscles (Abdominals and Obliques)

## Top Mistakes

- Allowing the hips to sag or stick up, which can lead to poor form and potential injury.
- Not utilizing a full range of motion; failing to lower fully, which reduces effectiveness.
- Using an overly high incline, which can take the emphasis off the target muscles.
- Holding the head too high or too low; the neck should be in a neutral position.
- Rushing the movement instead of focusing on controlled execution.

## Execution Tips

- Start with your hands shoulder-width apart, firmly on the elevated surface.
- Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels throughout the movement.
- Lower your chest towards the surface, inhaling as you go down.
- Push back up explosively, exhaling as you return to the starting position.
- Engage your core throughout the exercise to maintain balance and stability.

## Workouts Incorporating Incline Push Ups

Incorporate incline push-ups into a full-body routine or upper-body workout, pairing them with exercises such as:

- Bodyweight Squats
- Plank Variations
- Dumbbell Rows
- Lateral Raises
- Burpees

## Conclusion

The Body Weight Incline Push Up is a fantastic exercise that builds fundamental pushing strength while enhancing muscular endurance. By focusing on proper execution and avoiding common mistakes, you can effectively target multiple muscle groups, making it a valuable addition to any fitness regimen. Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned athlete, this exercise provides versatility and can support overall fitness goals.
