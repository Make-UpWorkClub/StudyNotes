# Comparison Theorem

Theorem that determines [[convergence]] of a function by comparing it to another function of known convergence

Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are functions such that $f(x) \ge g(x) \ge 0$ for $x\in [a, \infty)$.
Then,

1. If $\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x$ is convergent, then $\int_{a}^{\infty} g(x) \, \mathrm{d}x$ is also convergent.
2. If $\int_{a}^{\infty} g(x) \, \mathrm{d}x$ is divergent, then $\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x$ is also divergent.
