# Differentiability

Quality of a function:

- At a point $a$ if $\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$ ([[derivative]] at $a$) exists
- Over an open interval if every point of the interval is differentiable
- Over a closed interval if the open interval is differentiable and the left / right endpoints are right / left differentiable

Implies [[continuity]]

## Sidedness

Left differentiability at $a$ if $\lim_{ h \to 0^- } \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$ (left-side derivative at $a$) exists
Right differentiability at $a$ if $\lim_{ h \to 0^+ } \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$ (right-side derivative at $a$) exists
