# Fermat's Theorem

If $f$ has a [[extremum|local extremum]] at $x = c$, $f'(c) = 0$ or undefined (i.e. local extremum $\implies$ [[critical point]]).

> [!warning] The inverse is only true if $f'$ changes sign across $x = c$.

> [!warning] Does not apply to global extrema which can occur at non critical points.
