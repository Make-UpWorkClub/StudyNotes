# Linear Transformation

[[Random variable]] obtained from another through the relationship

$$
\begin{align}
Y = aX + b
\end{align}
$$

> [!example]+
> Let $X$ = number of 10$ bills randomly chosen from a pool of papers, $Y$ = total worth of the bills minus the entry fee (15\$), then $Y$ is a linear transformation of $X$:

> $$
> Y = 10X - 15
