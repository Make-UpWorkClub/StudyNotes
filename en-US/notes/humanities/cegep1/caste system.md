## Continuity

The rigid and inflexible caste system is perpetuated by:

- Caste isolation:
	- Birth (one is born into a fixed caste and cannot move caste)
	- Endogamy
	- Occupation
	- Commensality
- Ostracisation and violence against violators of caste norms
- Rape of lower caste women upper caste men as humiliation (also [[patriarchy]])
- Belief in karma (followers of caste norms reincarnate into a higher caste)
