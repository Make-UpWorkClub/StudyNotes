# Buddhism

[[Religion in South Asia|Indian religion]] or philosophy
Inspired by [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]]

Open-minded
Tolerant of other religions
Egalitarian, casteless
Non-Materialist
Initially misogynistic

## History

Founded partly as a reaction to the unequal [[caste system]]
Reflects the emergence of Vaishya (merchants) held back in power by Brahmin (priests) & Kshatriya (warriors)

Women wanted to live ascetic lives to escape from social traditions. At first, Gautama denied women from Buddhism, then he accepted, but created misogynistic rules that place nuns in subordinate position to monks.

Buddhist monks set up the earliest universities in history.

Buddhism declined in South Asia due to the resurgence of Hinduism and attempts by Brahmin and Kshatriya to regain power, but flourished throughout Asia.

In post-colonial India, Ambedkar and other scheduled castes escape caste oppression by converting to Buddhism.

## Deities

Initially, Buddha is regarded as the teacher, not the divine. Then, some started worshipping him as the divine.

## Monastic order

Buddhists can choose to live as lay persons or become monastics.
Marriage is disallowed for monastics.
