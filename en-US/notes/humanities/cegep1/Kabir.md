# Kabir

Medieval [[South Asia|Indian]] saint venerated by [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Sikhism|Sikhs]]

Against religious difference
Against religious hypocrisy (not adhering to the spirit of religion)
Critical of rituals <= Danger of being distracted by the form, forgetting the content

When he died, he was half buried by Muslims and half burned by Hindus => Shows religious harmony
