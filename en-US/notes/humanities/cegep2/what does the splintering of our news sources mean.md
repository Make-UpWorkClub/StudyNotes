# What does the splintering of our news sources mean?

- Death of newspaper
	- Causes:
		- Slower and less convenient than the Internet
		- Newspapers making their product smaller and less interesting
	- Consequences:
		- No one to research and verify the information
		- Fracturing of news sources, polarization, loss of agreed-upon set of facts
		- No one to keep the oppressed safe from injustice
- The Huffington Post
	- Bloggers work for free to be put beside celebrities
	- => devaluation of journalistic work
