# Mitochondrion

Membrane-bound [[organelle]] that transforms energy with [[cellular respiration]]
`Pl.` mitochondria

Number varies with cellular activity

Has two layers of membrane:

- Outer membrane: smooth and permeable
- Inner membrane:
	- Folded into cristae to increase the surface area
	- Contains enzymes involved in cellular respiration, e.g. ATP synthase
	- Contains **electron transport chain** (`abbr.` ETC)
		- 4 enzyme complexes (I, II, III & IV)
		- 2 $\mathrm{e^-}$ carriers (coenzyme Q & cytochrome C)
	- Inner space, called **matrix**, contains DNA, ribosomes and enzymes.
