# Dominance

(In a heterozygous pairing of [[allele|alleles]])
Dominance: *greater* influence of an allele over the other
Recessiveness: *lesser* influence of an allele over the other

## Completeness

Complete dominance: *complete* inhibition of the expression of recessive alleles
Partial / incomplete dominance: *partial* inhibition of the expression of recessive alleles resulting in *blended* expression of all alleles

## Codominance

Existence of multiple dominant alleles resulting in *clearly independent* expression of each allele

> [!example] A rooster with white and black alleles exhibiting both colours

> [!example] Codominance of $I^A$ and $I^B$ alleles makes blood type AB.

## Type of chromosome

Autosomal dominance: dominance of an allele on an *autosome*
Sex / X / Y-linked dominance: dominance of an allele on a *sex chromosome*

Sex-linked recessive disorders affect more males than females
