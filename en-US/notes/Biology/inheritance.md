# Inheritance

## Laws of Inheritance

Discovered by Mendel

### Law of dominance

An organism with at least one dominant allele displays the effect of the dominant allele.

### Law of segregation

During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate from each other so that each gamete only carries one allele for each gene.

### Law of independent assortment

Genes of different traits segregate independently.

## Patterns

### Epistasis

Expression of a [[gene]] that alters that of a different gene

> [!example] Gene for coat colour in Labrador retrievers affect the gene for deposition of pigment into hair.

### Pleiotropy

Expression of one gene on multiple characters
Inverse of polygenic inheritance

> [!example] Albinism

### Polygenic inheritance

Expression of multiple genes on one character
Inverse of pleiotropy

> [!example] Skin colour is determined by multiple genes.
