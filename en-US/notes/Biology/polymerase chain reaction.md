# Polymerase Chain Reaction

DNA amplification (mass [[DNA replication|replication]]) technique in vitro
`Abbr.` PCR

## Advantages

- Quick
- Targets specific sequence
- Requires a small amount of DNA

## Materials

- DNA
- Primers: short pieces of single stranded DNA complementary to either end of the template DNA
- Deoxynucleoside triphosphates (`abbr.` dNTPs): precursors
	- dATP, dGTP, dTTP, dCTP
- [[polymerase#Taq polymerase|Taq polymerase]]

## Steps

- Combine the materials in an eppendorf.
- Cycle:
	- Denaturation: the two strands of DNA are separated at high temperature.
		- 95°C
	- Annealing: primers bind to their complementary sequences of DNA.
		- 55°C
	- Polymerization: Taq polymerase synthesizes complementary DNA.
		- 72°C
- Repeat the cycle for exponential amplification.
