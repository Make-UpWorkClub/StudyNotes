# Allosteric Enzyme

Multi-polypeptide [[enzyme]] involved in the regulation of metabolic pathways
Each polypeptide has its own active site.

> [!abstract] Regulator
> `Coll.` allosteric activators & inhibitors

> [!abstract]+ Allosteric activator / inhibitor
> Molecule that weakly binds to an allosteric enzyme and stabilizes its *active* / *inactive* form
> **Never competitive** because it doesn't bind to the active site

> [!abstract] Allosteric site
> Location on an enzyme where a regulator binds
