# Plasma Membrane

Outer membrane of the cell
Part of the [[endomembrane system]]

Continuous with [[endoplasmic reticulum]]

## Transport across plasma membrane

See [[membrane#Transport across membrane]]

### Exocytosis

A transport vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane and empties payload outside.
A.k.a. secretion

Requires energy

### Endocytosis

Payload outside is wrapped by the plasma membrane into a transport [[vesicle]].

Requires energy

#### Phagocytosis

The cell extends **pseudopodia** (`sing.` pseudopodium) that surrounds the particles.
Forms a [[vacuole|food vacuole]]
When a macrophage engulfs a bacteria or when an amoeba engulfs its food

#### Pinocytosis

Forms a protein-coated vesicle

#### Receptor-mediated endocytosis

Specific molecules outside bind to receptors and are then wrapped.
Forms a protein-coated vesicle
