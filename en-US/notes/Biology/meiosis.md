# Meiosis

Division of [[somatic cell|somatic cells]] into [[gamete|gametes]]

Properties:

- *2* cell divisions
- *4 different haploid* daughter cells

Phases:

- Meiosis I
	- Prophase I
	- Metaphase I
	- Anaphase I
	- Telophase I
	- Cytokinesis I
		- **The daughter cells are already haploid.**
- Meiosis II **(similar to [[mitosis]])**
	- Prophase II
	- Metaphase II
	- Anaphase II
	- Telophase II
	- Cytokinesis II

> [!important] Meiosis includes cytokinesis, unlike meiosis.
