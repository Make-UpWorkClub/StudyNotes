# Prophase

First phase of [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]]

Steps:

1. Mitosis & prophase I: Chromatin fibres condense into discrete chromosomes
2. Prophase I: homologous chromosomes form a pair called **tetrad**
3. Prophase I: **crossing over:** homologous chromosomes exchange segments at **chiasmata**
	- Basis of independent assortment
4. Nucleoli disappear
5. Microtubules from centrosomes lengthen to form the mitotic spindle
6. Animal cells: centrosomes move apart to two poles
7. Nuclear envelope fragments
8. Microtubules attach to chromosomes by kinetochores
