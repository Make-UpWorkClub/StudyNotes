Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] through natural selection

Based on observations:

- Species are remarkably adapted to their environment
- 

Mechanism of natural selection:

- Phenotypic variation: individuals of a population vary
- Genetic variation: some of the differences are inheritable
- Overproduction
- Competition: individuals must compete for limited resources
	- Food
	- Territory
	- Mate
