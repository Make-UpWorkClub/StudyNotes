# Lewis Structure

2D diagram of electron bonds in a molecule

Steps:

1. Determine the skeleton structure of the compound
	- In general, ==the least electronegative atom occupies the central position.==
	- Prefer symmetry if possible
2. Compute the total number of valence electrons
3. Draw bonds using lone pairs to respect the octet rule

> [!abstract]+ Octet rule
> Rule of thumb that states:
>
> - A main-group element tends to form bonds until it has eight valence electrons.
> - Carbon usually forms four bonds (no lone pairs).
> - Halogens in terminal position only form single bonds.
> 	- Fluorine must be in terminal position.
>
> Exceptions:
>
> - **Expanded octet**: more than eight valence electrons
> 	- Central atoms from 3<sup>rd</sup> period and beyond might have an expanded octet.
> - **Incomplete octet**: less than eight valence electrons

> [!abstract] Duet rule
> Rule of thumb that states the valence shells of hydrogen and helium are complete with only two valence electrons
