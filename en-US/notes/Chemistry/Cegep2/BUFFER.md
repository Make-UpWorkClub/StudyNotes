# Buffer

# 2025-02-03

Percent composition: percentage of mass of an element in a compound

# Halide

Binary compound containing a halogen
Mostly ionic

> [!abstract] Halide ion
> Halogen atom bearing a negative charge

# Wavelength

Distance between two peaks in a wave
`Sym.` $\lambda$

# Frequency

Number of peaks that pass through a point in one second
`Sym.` $v$

# Electrostatic Potential Map

Visual representation of [[electron]] distribution of a molecule

# Resonyance

Equal plausibility of multiple [[Lewis Structure|Lewis structures]]

Differ in the position of electrons

# Formal Charge

Hypothetical charge of an atom if

# 2025-05-01

- Melting point and boiling point increase when molar mass increases

# 2025-05-07

# Dynamic Equilibrium

State where the rate of the forward and reverse reactions are equal and the concentration of the reagents and products remain constant

# Vapour Pressure

Pressure of vapour
0 atm at melting point, atmospheric pressure at boiling point
Increases with temperature

# Melting Point

Point at a certain pressure in the phase diagram at which *solid* and *liquid* phases coexist in dynamic equilibrium
`Syn.` freezing point (of a liquid)

> [!abstract] Normal melting point
> Melting point at 1 atm

# Boiling Point

Point at a certain pressure in the phase diagram at which *liquid* and *gaseous* phases coexist in dynamic equilibrium
`Syn.` condensation point (of a gas)

> [!abstract] Normal boiling point
> Boiling point at 1 atm

# Triple Point

Point in the phase diagram at which *all three* phases coexist in dynamic equilibrium


# Critical Point

Point in the phase diagram above which the substance becomes a [[supercritical fluid]]

> [!abstract] Critical temperature
> `Sym.` $T_c$

> [!abstract] Critical pressure
> `Sym.` $P_c$

# Supercritical Fluid
