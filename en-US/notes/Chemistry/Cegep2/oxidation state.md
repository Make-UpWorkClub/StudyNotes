# Oxidation State

Hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to other atoms are ionic, i.e. if electrons are completely transferred in the direction indicated by electronegativity
`Syn.` oxidation number

Sum of oxidation numbers in a molecule = 0
Sum of oxidation numbers in an ion = charge of ion
