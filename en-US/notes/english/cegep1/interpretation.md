# Interpretation

Perspective on the information presented by a literary work

Themes are interpretations
Thematic analysis produces interpretations

## Types

### Textual

> [!example] Red Riding Hood represents a victim of sexual assault.

### Thematic

Based on textual interpretation
More insightful than textual interpretation

> [!example] "Little Red Riding Hood" suggests that the real threat of sexual violence is from the familiar.
