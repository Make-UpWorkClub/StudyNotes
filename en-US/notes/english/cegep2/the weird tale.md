## Categories

According to Joshi:

*Actual* violation of natural laws
*Different* set of natural laws

### Supernatural horror

*Actual* violation of natural laws
*Same* set of natural laws

### Nonsupernatural horror

*Illusory* violation of natural laws

>[!example] Ghost that isn't actually a ghost

#### Psychological horror

Supernatural phenomena explained by psychology

##### Pseudosupernatural

Supernatural phenomena explained by insanity

> [!example] Ghost is a hallucination

##### Conte cruel

Supernatural phenomena wrongly explained by fate

### Quasi science fiction

Sophistication of supernatural horror

The advent of science protects us from the unknown. We think we are safe, but are actually utterly ignorant about the inner workings of the universe.
=> realization of our *ignorance* of certain greater natural laws creates horror.

Ignorance is bliss: the pursuit of knowledge leads humans to learn things they aren't supposed to know.

### Others

#### Ambiguous horror

Maintains the doubt of supernatural until the end
