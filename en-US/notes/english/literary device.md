# Literary Device

- Like colours in that they characterize the text
- Not just recognized, but also analyzed

## Types

- Repetition
- In film:
	- POV
	- Set
	- Efects
	- Blocking
	- Costumes
	- Lighting
	- Props
	- Music
	- Scenes
	- Dialogue / monologue

### Blocking

Position of characters / objects in the scene, e.g. being in the back = ignored

### Diction

- Denotation vs connotation
- Double-meaning

### Juxtaposition

Contrast (very different) or comparison (mostly the same)

### Motif

Recurrent device, formula, or situation in literature

### Allusion

Brief, often implicit and indirect reference to something outside of the text
`E.g.` imaginary or historical person, place or thing
