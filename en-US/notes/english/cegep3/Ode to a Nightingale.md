- 4
	- Imagery: wings of poesy allows escape from reality
	- Metaphor: poetry as light from heaven in an otherwise dark world of despair

	- Silent death of the speaker vs loud singing of the nightingale
- 7
	- Mortal nature of humans vs immortal legacy of birds
	- Individual vs species
- 8
	- Speaker functionally dead when the song of the nightingale fades
	- Wake or sleep: suffer in reality and reason or die from the loss of poetic inspiration
- Mortal art of humans can be more special than immortal song of the nightingale?
