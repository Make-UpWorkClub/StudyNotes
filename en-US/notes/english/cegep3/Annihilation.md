## Themes

### Self-destruction and change

- Team members go into 
- Death is self-destruction coded into genes
- Suicide mission
- Contrary to other members, Josie chooses acceptance of death or change
	- => the Shimmer reflects inner desires?
- Self-destruction is actually change
- Lena rejects her new self, but still changes => change is inevitable
- The one who escaped is Lena's mirror
	- <= as she realizes that her motivation is guilt towards her husband, she chooses self-destruction and dies with her husband.
	- <= she caresses the corpse of her husband as she is burning.
	- <= she goes inside the cave to make sure it is destroyed.

### Refraction

- The Shimmer refracts electromagnetic wave and DNA like a prism
- Motif: glass of water
	- Refracts light like the Shimmer
- Motif: Lena is a liar
- Cell division as mirror of self
