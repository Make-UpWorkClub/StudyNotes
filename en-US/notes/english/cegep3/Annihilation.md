## Topic

### Self-destruction and change

- Cancer is self-destruction
	- Situational irony: cancer in cervix
	- Shimmer is cancer
	- Underground room = cervix
- Death is self-destruction coded into genes
- Suicide mission
- Self-destruction is actually change
	- Contrary to other members, Josie accepts the Shimmer change
		- => the Shimmer reflects inner desires?
	- Cancer can be beautiful
- Lena rejects her new self, but still changes => change is inevitable
- The one who escaped is Lena's mirror
	- <= as she realizes that her motivation is guilt towards her husband, she chooses self-destruction and dies with her husband.
	- <= she caresses the corpse of her husband as she is burning.
	- <= she goes inside the cave to make sure it is destroyed.

### Refraction

- Lena means light
- The Shimmer refracts electromagnetic wave and DNA like a prism
- Motif: glass of water
	- Refracts light like the Shimmer
- Motif: Lena is a liar
	- => light is deceptive
- Cell division as mirror of self
- Mirror of self reflects every action
	- Mechanistic materialism
