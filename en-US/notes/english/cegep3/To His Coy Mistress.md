# To His Coy Mistress

[[Carpe Diem]] poem that praises and tries to convince a mistress to have sex

- "vegetable love": reductionist
- "last age should show your heart" 
- Worms: phallic imagery
- Fine grave: irony
- Last stanza: optimism, plural pronoun
- "youthful hue" and "willing soul": transient
- "sits" and "transpires":
	- Static vs dynamic
	- Remain the same vs Reveal the truth
- "thy skin" and "every pore":
	- Amplification
	- Yonic pore
	- Smooth vs rough
	- Surface vs deep
- Sport: mutual activity
- "amorous birds of prey":
	- Birds have rituals of love
	- Both are equally preys
- Make the sun run: gain power through sex
