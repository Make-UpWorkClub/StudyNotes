# War in Translation

- To witness:
	- To die for a cause is to be witnessed by others (God or other people)
	- Gives life meaning and justifies death
- Collective vs. individual
	- Legacy as burden
	- Legacy as barrier to integrate into the new society
	- Surrounding gives meaning to the individual
	- Legacy lives on
	- Language as communal heritage
- Media:
	- Language as war drum
		- Push people towards extremes
	- Headline as bomb
	- Sentence as coffin
- Translation:
	- Erotic act
	- Transplant
	- Bomb
	- Smuggling
	- Witness
