# Gilgamesh

Might be the first major piece of literature
Incomplete
Reconstruction from different versions

## Themes

### Sexism

Shamhat (the harlot):

- Nameless in the translated version => diminutive
- "Child of pleasure" => diminutive
- Only exists for a specific purpose, no free will

### Sex

Reserved for the wise <= Enkidu gains wisdom through sex.

### Wisdom

A blessing and a curse

- <= Enkidu loses his strength when he gains wisdom.
- <= Enkidu curses the trapper and Shamhat for exposing him to wisdom, then he blesses Shamhat for introducing him to Gilgamesh.

### Fate

- No free will
	- <= foreshadowing dreams
	- <= unbreakable curses
- Fate chosen by the Anunnaki (judges) and Mammetun (mother of destinies)

### Death

- Everyone is equal in death.
	- => the powerful fear death more because they will lose their power.
- When one becomes aware of death, one wants to prove their worth and be remembered by everyone.

## Characters

### Gods

- Easily persuaded
- Corrupt
