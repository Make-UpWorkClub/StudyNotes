- Before class:
	- Do preparation as asked by the teacher
	- Review the material

	- Be concentrated
		- **Rest well!!!**
	- Synthesize
	- **Do not record the lesson (not allowed)**
- After class:
	- Ask classmates, friends and teachers
	- Review frequently (curve for forgetting)

### Digital

- Use snippets
- Use buffers to temporarily store information, which is then extracted when complete
	- Bullet points
- Annotate with *italic*, **bold**, ==highlight==, `quote`, blockquote, callout
	- **importance** vs ==relevance==
- Prefer backlinks
	- They show order of importance ("parent" nodes are bigger in the graph)
	- More natural
- Evaluate importance of relation before linking
	- Unnecessary links lead to an incomprehensible graph
- Use normal case for filenames
	- Most wikilinks are lowercase
	- Faster to type
	- Shows casing of proper nouns

### Hand-drawn

- Use abbreviations and symbols
- Use colours

#### Flowchart

- Start with a central circle
- Use keywords with description
