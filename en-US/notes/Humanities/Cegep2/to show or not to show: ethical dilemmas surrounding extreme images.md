	- Censored by American media
	- Readers outraged by "disrespectful and invasive content"
	- Weaponisation of trauma
	- Pro-not show:
		- Invade a private moment of life
	- Pro-show:
		- Inform the public of the real narrative
		- Witness the choice to die
		- People consider suicide as shameful due to post-9/11 patriotism
		- Make people uncomfortable to push them to reflect on the moral dilemma
- War photo
	- In the Iraq war and Vietnam war
	- Pro-not show:
		- Not family friendly
		- Repeated traumatic images can dull emotional understanding
	- Pro-show:
		- Not publishing is deceiving the public of the consequences of war
		- Challenge the dominant narrative of the good war
		- War shouldn't be sensationalized
		- War shouldn't be censored
		- Hardware footage removes empathy
		- Offend the viewer to make them feel accountable, to implicate them in the war
