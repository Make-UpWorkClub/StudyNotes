%% [[Contemporary Issues in the Media]] %%

# Partisanship and the News

- Fox News
	- Owned by Australian billionaire Rupert Murdock
	- Now operated by his son Lachlan Murdock
	- Hugely popular with elderly people
	- Own identity
	- Mutual influence with Trump
	- Sins:
		- Knowingly lies
		- Exploits confusion to create mass suspicion and cynicism
			- "everything was possible and [...] nothing was true"
		- Exploits fear-mongering
			- War rationalizes immoral behaviour
		- Politicizes news
		- Distracts from real crises
		- Destroys empathy and creates narcissism
			- War rhetoric
				- Rationalises immoral behaviour in times of peace
			- Us vs them (like team sports)
				- "You are under attack. They are coming for you."
				- Them: ethnic groups, Dems, the media, etc.
	- Impossible to argue with people who speak Fox
		- Different language with its own lexicons (symbols)
		- Alternate reality
