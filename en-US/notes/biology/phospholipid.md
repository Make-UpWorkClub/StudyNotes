Amphipathic
Phosphate group (*head*): *hydrophilic*
Fatty acids (*tails*): *hydrophobic*

> [!abstract]+ Micelle
> Phospholipid aggregate in water (hydrophilic heads outward in contact with water, hydrophobic tails inward)

## Structure

Composed of:

- Hydrophilic R group
- Phosphate
- Glycerol
- Two fatty acids joined to glycerol by **ester linkage**
	- In Archaea: two isoprenoids joined to glycerol by **ether linkage**
