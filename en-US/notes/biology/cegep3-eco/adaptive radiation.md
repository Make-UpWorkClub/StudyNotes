# adaptive radiation

Rapid diversification of organisms from a single ancestral species, particularly when new resources or biological niches are available

- Rapid = millions of years instead of 100 millionsâ€”billions of years
- Characterizes many geological period changes

Historical causes:

- Multicellularity
- Colonization of land
- Mass extinctions, e.g. dinosaur extinction enabled radiation of mammals
- Continental drift
