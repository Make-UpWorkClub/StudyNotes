# Hardy-Weinberg equations

Equations used to predict:

- The allele and genotype relative frequencies in a **stable** population
- Whether a population is stable or evolving

Assume the population is stable, let $p$ and $q$ be relative frequencies of the dominant and recessive alleles respectively, then:

$$
\begin{align}
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 & = 1 \\
p + q & = 1
\end{align}
$$

## Examples

> In a Hardy-Weinberg population, 4% have cystic fibrosis caused by the recessive allele. What is the percent of carriers (heterozygous individuals) of this disease in this population?

$$
\begin{align}
q^2 & = 0.04 \\
q & = 0.2 \\
 \\
p + q & = 1 \\
p & = 0.8 \\
 \\
2pq & = 0.32
\end{align}
$$

> We observe 60% AA individuals and 40% aa individuals. Is the population stable?

Because there is no Aa individual, the Hardy-Weinberg equation is not satisfied, so the population is not stable.
