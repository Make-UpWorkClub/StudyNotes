# Darwinism

Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]

Mechanism:

- Variation
	- Phenotypic variation: individuals of a population vary.
	- [[gene#Genetic variation|Genetic variation]]: some of the differences are inheritable.
- Overproduction: species tend to produce more offsprings than can survive.
- Competition: individuals must compete for limited resources.
	- Food
	- Territory
	- Mate
- Differential success: the fittest survives and reproduces.

Evidence:

- Species are remarkably adapted to their environment.
- Artificial selection: if humans can select traits through selective breeding, so can nature.
