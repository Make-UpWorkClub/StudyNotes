# microevolution

[[Evolution]] with changes in allele frequencies but no new species

> [!example] Tibetans evolve to have low concentration of blood cells to reduce blood clots.

## Agents

- Mutation
- Natural selection
- Gene flow between populations through migration
- **Genetic drift**: random force that has limited influence on small populations
	- **Founder effect**: inheritance from a few founders of an isolated population
		- `E.g.` Ellis-van Creveld syndrome in the Amish
		- `E.g.` Leigh syndrome in French Canadians
	- **Bottleneck effect**: random elimination by catastrophic event
		- => reduced genetic diversity
- Nonrandom breeding
	- <= homozygote is usually less fit
