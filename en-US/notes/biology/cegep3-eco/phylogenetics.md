# phylogenetics

Study of the [[evolution|evolutionary]] history of [[life]]

> [!abstract] phylogenetic tree
> Tree representing the evolutionary history of [[taxonomy|taxa]]
> `Aka.` phylogeny

## Hypothesis

The phylogenetic relationship is hypothesized by:

- **Morphological characters**
  `E.g.` size, shape, structure
	- Cheaper and more accessible
- **Molecular characters**
  `E.g.` DNA and protein sequences
	- Dominant and more accurate

## Types of evolutionary similarity

- **Homology**: similarity between taxa due to *shared history*
	- Arises through *divergent* evolution
	- `E.g.` the arrangement of bones in the forelimbs of mammals
- **Analogy**: similarity between taxa due to *adaptation to similar environments*
	- Arises through *convergent* evolution
	- `E.g.` modification of forelimbs into fins in both whales and penguins
	- **Homoplasy**: molecular analogy

> [!info] In general, the more complex the features similar between two taxa (e.g. similar DNA sequences), the more likely they are homologous.

> [!example] Analogy: marsupial and placental evolve similar structures in dark tunnels.

> [!example] Analogy: sugar glider and flying squirrel evolve gliding wings independently.

> [!example] Homology: chicken and human embryos look similar.
