- Early Earth
	- Reducing atmosphere (no oxygen)
	- Electrically charged
	- Hot
	- CO2, H2, N2, water vapor
- Protocell
	- Origin of first cells
	- Packaged into vesicles surrounded by membrane
	- Uses RNA because more catalytic than DNA, e.g. ribozymes
	- Reproduces by binary fission
	- Maintains homeostasis
- First cell
	- Prokaryote
	- Needs:
		- Amino acids, sugars, nucleotides
		- Water
		- No oxygen
		- Energy
- Autotrophy
	- Dependency on light energy and inorganic molecules
	- Uses photosynthesis
	- Includes consumers and decomposers
- Heterotrophy
	- Dependency on other organisms for their energy and nutrients
	- Mostly aerobic
- Aerobic
	- Requires O2
- Anaerobic
	- Does not require O2
- Facultative
	- Can live in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions
- Obligate
	- Can only live in either aerobic or anaerobic conditions

- Formation of ozone layer
	- UV forms O3 from O2 in the upper atmosphere
	- O3 absorbs UV
	- Decreases mutagenesis
- Adaptive radiation
	- Rapid diversification
	- Historical causes:
		- Multicellularity
		- Colonization of land
		- Mass extinctions, e.g. dinosaur extinction enabled radiation of mammals
		- Continental drift
- Mass extinction
	- Extinction of >75% of species within 1-10 million years
	- Natural extinction rate: 1 in a million species becomes extinct per year
	- Current extinction rate: 100-1000 times higher

# similar species

> [!abstract]+ morphological species
> Organisms with similar body shapes, sizes and other structural features

> [!abstract]+ biological species
> Organisms that interbreed and produce fertile offsprings

> [!abstract]+ ecological species
> Organisms that share the same ecological niche

> [!abstract]+ phylogenetic species
> Organisms that share common ancestry based on DNA sequences
