# natural selection

Adaptation of organisms to the environment by competition
`Ant.` artificial selection, e.g. breeding dogs

Mechanism:

- Phenotypic variation: individuals of a population vary
- [[gene#Genetic variation|Genetic variation]]: some of the differences are inheritable
	- <= mutation
- Overproduction: species tend to produce more offsprings than can survive
- Competition: individuals must compete for limited resources
	- Food
	- Territory
	- Mate
- Differential success: the most fit survives and reproduces

> Ability to survive and to reproduce

## Types

### Directional selection

Trait evolves towards *one extreme*

> [!example] Evolution of horse towards larger size and one toed

> [!example] Industrial melanization of moths
> Environment becomes darker => moths become darker

### Disruptive selection

Trait evolves towards *both extremes*

> [!example] Adaptive radiation
> Rapid evolution of 

> [!example] Batesian mimicry
> Mimicry where a harmless species mimics the warning signals of a toxic species

> [!example] Evolution of seedcracker birds towards two beak sizes

### Stabilizing selection

Trait evolves towards the *center*

> [!example]+ Sickle cell disease
> Homozygous dominant: suffers from sickle cell
> Homozygous recessive: suffers from malaria
> Heterozygous: protected from both
> => evolution of humans in malaria regions to be heterozygous
> 
> > [!abstract] Heterozygote advantage
> > Genetic advantage of being heterozygous for a specific trait
