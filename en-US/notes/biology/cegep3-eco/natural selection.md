# natural selection

Adaptation of organisms to the environment by competition
`Ant.` artificial selection, e.g. breeding dogs

Forces:

- Competition
	- Interspecific
	- Intraspecific
		- Sexual selection: competition for mates
- Predation
- Parasitism
- Mutualism

> [!abstract] fitness
> Ability to survive and to reproduce

## Types

### Directional selection

Trait evolves towards *one extreme*

> [!example] Evolution of horse towards larger size and one toe

> [!example] Industrial melanization of moths
> Environment becomes darker => moths become darker

### Disruptive selection

Trait evolves towards *both extremes*

> [!example] Adaptive radiation

> [!example] Batesian mimicry
> Mimicry where a harmless species mimics the warning signals of a toxic species

> [!example] Evolution of seedcracker birds towards two beak sizes

### Stabilizing selection

Trait evolves towards the *center*

> [!example]+ Sickle cell anemia
> Homozygous dominant: suffers from sickle cell anemia
> Homozygous recessive: suffers from malaria
> Heterozygous: protected from both
> => evolution of humans in malaria regions to be heterozygous
> 
> > [!abstract] Heterozygote advantage
> > Genetic advantage of being heterozygous for a specific trait
