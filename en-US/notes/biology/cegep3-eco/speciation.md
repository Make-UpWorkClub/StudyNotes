# speciation

[[Evolution]] with emergence of new [[species]]

Requires a barrier to prevent gene flow between subpopulations

## Modes

### Allopatric

*Physical separation* of species
=> no gene flow, independent evolution

> [!example] Lake separated in two => fishes evolve separately

> [!example] The two sides of Grand Canyon are inhabited by different species.

### Sympatric

*No physical separation* of species

Agents:

- Natural selection (competition for food leads to occupation of different niches)
- Nonrandom breeding

> [!example] Small fishes mate with small fishes, and large ones mate with large ones.
