# speciation

[[Evolution]] with emergence of new [[species]]

- Requires a ==barrier== to prevent gene flow between subpopulations, ensuring independent evolution
- Complete after ==reproductive isolation== and infertile offspring

## Modes

### Allopatric

*Physical separation* of species

> [!example] Lake separated in two => fishes evolve separately

> [!example] The two sides of Grand Canyon are inhabited by different species.

### Sympatric

*No physical separation* of species

Agents:

- Natural selection (competition for food leads to occupation of different niches)
- Nonrandom breeding
- Polyploidy

> [!example] Small fishes mate with small fishes, and large ones mate with large ones.

> [!example] Darwin's finches

## Reproductive barrier

- Prezygotic: blocks zygote formation
	- Habitat isolation
	- Temporal isolation
		- `E.g.` different mating seasons
	- Behavioral isolation
	- Mechanical isolation
		- `E.g.` incompatible mating organs
		- `E.g.` flowers: different animal pollinators
	- Gametic isolation
- Postzygotic: prevents hybrid from being fit
	- Reduced viability
	- Reduced fertility
	- Hybrid breakdown
