# cladistics

Approach to [[taxonomy]] in which species are placed in [[phyly#Monophyly|clades]]

Steps:

1. Select an **outgroup** (taxon known to have diverged before the group in study, `ant.` **ingroup**).
2. Select derived characters.
	- `E.g.` for flowers:
		- Clear distinction between sepal and petal
		- Fusion petals
		- Type of venation (reticulate vs parallel) of leaf
		- Position of gynoecium
		- Angle between petals
3. Make a matrix of presence of characters in the groups.
4. Construct the [[phylogenetics#^c3e48f|phylogenetic tree]] based on common characters.
	- **Maximum parsimony** favours the simplest tree (with the least character state changes).
	- **Maximum likelihood** favours the tree most likely to have produced the different DNA sequences.
