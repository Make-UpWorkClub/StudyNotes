# evolution

Changes in the gene pool and adaptations of a population over time

- Not instantaneous, but slow incremental changes accumulating over time
- Not goal oriented but adaptive
- Branching
- Responsible for biodiversity

Types:

- Microevolution
- Speciation
- Macroevolution

## Evidences

- Direct observation
- Fossil record
- Biogeography
	- Continental drift influences species distribution
- **Comparative morphology**: comparison of structures and organs between species
	- > [!abstract] vestigial structure
	  > Defective structure that occupies no function, relic of evolution

	- > [!abstract] homologous structure
	  > One of structures with *same* origin but *different* functions

	- > [!abstract] analogous structure
	  > One of structures with *different* origins but *same* function
- **Comparative embryology**: comparison of embryo formation between species
	- In vertebrates
- **Comparative biochemistry**: comparison of protein and DNA sequences between species
