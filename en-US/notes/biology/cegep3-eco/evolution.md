# evolution

Changes in the gene pool and adaptations of a population over time

- Slow
- Not goal oriented but adaptive
- Branching
- Responsible for biodiversity

Types:

- Microevolution
- Speciation
- Macroevolution

## Evidences

### Direct observation

### Fossil record

### Biogeography

### Comparative morphology

Comparison of structures and organs between species

> [!abstract] vestigial structure
> Defective structure that occupies no function, relic of evolution

> [!abstract] homologous structure
> One of structures with *same* origin but *different* functions

> [!abstract] analogous structure
> One of structures with *different* origins but *same* function
