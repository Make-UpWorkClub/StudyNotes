[[monomer|Monomer]] of polypeptide and protein

- Although 500+ exist in nature, only 22 are found in proteins.
	- ==<= they have the best coverage of different characteristics such as size, charge and hydrophobicity.==
- [[chirality|Chiral]]
	- Almost all amino acids used by life on Earth are L-form.

Classifications:

- *Nonpolar* side chains: *hydrophobic*
- *Polar* side chains: *hydrophilic*
- *Electrically charged* side chains: *hydrophilic*
