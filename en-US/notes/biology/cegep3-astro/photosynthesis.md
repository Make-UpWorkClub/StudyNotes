# photosynthesis

Synthesis of glucose from light

$\ce{H_2O + CO_2 -> O_2 + C_6H_{12}O_6}$

## Steps

![[photosynthesis.png]]

### Light dependent reactions

$\ce{H_2O + NADP+ + ADP -> O_2 + NADPH + ATP}$

Chlorophyll absorbs solar energy and excites an electron. The electron releases energy via ETC to make ATP.

### Calvin cycle

$\ce{CO_2 + NADPH + ATP -> C_6H_{12}O_6}$

CO2 is reduced to glucose while H2O is oxidized.

## Non-oxygenic

Photosynthesis without producing oxygen

In haleoarchaea, **bacteriorhodopsin** (a retinal molecule) absorbs light directly to pump protons to generate a proton gradient, which powers ATP synthase. Then, ATP provides energy to reduce CO2.
