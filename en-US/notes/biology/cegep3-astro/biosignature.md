# biosignature

Sign of [[life]]

- High homochirality of biological molecules
	- <= homochiral preference of life on Earth
	- <= non-biological reaction typically produces equal chirality
- **Hopanoids**: lipids in bacterial membranes
	- <= very resilient to extreme conditions; can be preserved for millions of years
- Simultaneous presence of methane and oxygen
	- <= exothermic reaction of methane with oxygen; the half-life of methane on Earth is only ~10 years
