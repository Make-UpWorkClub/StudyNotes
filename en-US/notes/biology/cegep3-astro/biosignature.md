# biosignature

Evidence of current or past [[life]]

- High homochirality of biological molecules
	- <= homochiral preference of life on Earth
	- <= non-biological reaction typically produces equal chirality
- **Hopanoids**: lipids in bacterial membranes
	- <= very resilient to extreme conditions; can be preserved for millions of years
- C12 preference over C13
	- <= lighter and easier to incorporate into molecules
- Gases:
	- Simultaneous presence of methane and oxygen
		- <= exothermic reaction of methane with oxygen; the half-life of methane on Earth is only ~10 years
	- Oxygen
		- Deduced from presence of ozone
		- <= highly reactive; needs constant production such as oxygenic photosynthesis
	- Seasonal variation of carbon dioxide level
	- **Dimethyl sulfide** (DMS)
		- <= produced by marine prokaryotes and algae
		- <= no currently known abiotic synthesis mechanism
