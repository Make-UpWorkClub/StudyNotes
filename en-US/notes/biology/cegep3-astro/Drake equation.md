# Drake equation

Equation that calculates the current number of extraterrestrial [[life]] in the Milky Way

$$
N = \underbrace{R_*f_pn_e}_{N_{ast}}\underbrace{f_lf_if_c}_{f_{bt}}L
$$

- $N_{ast} = R_*f_pn_e$: habitable planet formation rate
	- $R_* \approx 1.5$: star formation rate in the Milky Way
	- $f_p \approx 0.95$: proportion of stars with planets
	- $n_e \approx 0.06$: number of planets capable of supporting life
- $f_{bt} = f_lf_if_c$: proportion of intelligence
	- $f_l \approx 0.5$: proportion of life that arises
	- $f_i < 0.1$: proportion of life that evolves intelligence
	- $f_c \approx 1$: proportion of intelligence that can / want to release detectable signals
- $L$: average lifetime of a civilization
