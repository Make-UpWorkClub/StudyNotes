# Buffer

- nebula: galactic cloud
- solar system: stars and planets that orbit it
- astrobiology: study of life in the universe

## 2025-08-22

- Criteria:
	- Habitable zone
	- Adequate temperature
		- Liquid water
		- Eccentricity of planet not too high

# source of elements

- Big Bang nucleosynthesis
	- Matter made from extremely intense light within the first 5 minutes => *proton (hydrogen), electron & neutron*
	- Nuclear fusion: collision of hydrogen within the first few hours => *helium*
- Low mass star (red giant)
	- CNO cycle => *helium*
- High mass star (supergiant)
	- Helium capture => *elements until iron*
	- Star explodes to become neutron star => *gold & uranium*
- White dwarf supernovae => *iron-group elements*
- Radioactive decay => *radioactive elements*
- Neutron star
	- => neutron
	- R-process: merge of neutron stars => *radioactive elements*
- Cosmic ray spallation => *beryllium & bore*
- Human-made => *synthetic elements like technetium*

# escape speed

Minimum speed needed for an object to escape the gravitational field of another object

$$
v_i = \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{\circ}}{R_{\circ}}}
$$

> [!note]- Proof
> $$
> \begin{align}
K_i + U_i & = K_f + U_f \\
\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 & = \frac{GM_{\circ}m}{R_{\circ}} \\
v_i & = \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{\circ}}{R_{\circ}}}
\end{align}
> $$

> [!example]+ Determine the escape speed of the moon.
> $$
> v_i = \sqrt{\frac{2GM_\text{moon}}{R_\text{moon}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1\cdot6.67\cdot10^{-11}\cdot7.348\cdot10^{22}}{1737000}} = 2.375\pu{\frac{m}{s}}

# Kepler's Laws

## First Law

The orbit of planets around the sun is an ellipse.

> [!abstract] eccentricity
> Measure of how ellipse-like the orbit is

## Second Law

A planet sweeps out equal areas of its orbit in equal times.
`Aka.` conservation of angular momentum

## Third Law

More distant planets orbit at slower speeds, obeying the relationship

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(m_1 + m_2)}a^3
$$

Therefore, to determine the mass of a planet:

$$
m_p\sin i \approx \frac{(v_*\sin i)\sqrt{1 - e^2}}{28.4 \frac{m}{s}}\left( \frac{T}{1\pu{year}} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}\left( \frac{M_*}{M_{\circ}} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}}M_J
$$

# nebular theorem

The Solar System forms from a nebula that collapses on itself.

# Hot Jupiter

Gas giant exoplanets physically similar to Jupiter but extremely close to their star
