# escape speed

Minimum speed needed for an object to escape the gravitational field of another object

$$
v_i = \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{\circ}}{R_{\circ}}}
$$

> [!note]- Proof

> \begin{align}
K_i + U_i & = K_f + U_f \\
\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 & = \frac{GM_{\circ}m}{R_{\circ}} \\
v_i & = \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{\circ}}{R_{\circ}}}
\end{align}

# Kepler's Laws

## First Law

The orbit of planets around the sun is an ellipse.

> [!abstract] eccentricity
> Measure of how ellipse-like the orbit is

## Second Law

A planet sweeps out equal areas of its orbit in equal times.
`Aka.` conservation of angular momentum

## Third Law

More distant planets orbit at slower speeds, obeying the relationship

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(m_1 + m_2)}a^3
$$

Therefore, to determine the mass of a planet:

$$
m_p\sin i \approx \frac{(v_*\sin i)\sqrt{1 - e^2}}{28.4 \frac{m}{s}}\left( \frac{T}{1\pu{year}} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}\left( \frac{M_*}{M_{\circ}} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}}M_J
$$

# nebular theorem

The Solar System forms from a nebula that collapses on itself.

# Hot Jupiter

Gas giant exoplanets physically similar to Jupiter but extremely close to their star
