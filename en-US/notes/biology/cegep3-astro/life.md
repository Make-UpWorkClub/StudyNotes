# life

Characteristics:

- Organization
- Information
	- Erwin Schrodinger: ==only aperiodic solids hold information==
- Metabolism
	- Energy transformation
	- Reaction
- Evolution
	- Change in the information

> [!info]+ Viking mission
> Experiment #1: presence of metabolism on Mars
> Experiment #2: absence of organic molecules on Mars
> => if no life: evidence of metabolism may be produced inorganically
> => if life: life may exist in inorganic form
> => possible contamination

## Criteria

- Habitable zone
- Adequate temperature
	- Eccentricity of planet not too high
	- Greenhouse gas effect
	- <= liquid water
	- <= fluid membrane
- Adequate pH
- Essential elements:
	- Carbon
	- Hydrogen
	- Nitrogen
	- Oxygen
	- Phosphorus
	- Silicon
- Water
	- <= very polar; forms H-bonds
	- <= cohesive and adhesive
	- <= high heat capacity => stable atmosphere / ocean / organism temperature
	- <= denser as a liquid than a solid => allows ice to float
- Final electron acceptor
	- O2

## Alternative forms

- Silicon based
	- More reactive than carbon; forms weaker bonds
		- Advantage ==in low-temperature environments==
	- Disadvantage: ==spontaneous reaction with oxygen== to form the very stable silicate
		- Si-O stronger than C-O bonds
- Should have a similar set of proteinogenic [[amino acid|amino acids]] to cover a wide range of properties
- Ammonia as solvent
	- Abundant
	- Disadvantage: smaller liquid range
- Methane as solvent
	- Abundant
	- Advantage: liquid in low-temperature environments
	- Disadvantage: smaller liquid range
	- Disadvantage: non-polar
		- **Azotosome**: theoretical nitrogen-based inside-out membrane that form in methane
- May have similar adaptations to Archaea
- Probably not wheeled
