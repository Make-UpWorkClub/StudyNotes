# Solar System

## Sun

- 99.9% of total mass
- Mostly gas

## Terrestrial planets

- *Solid*

### Mercury

- Desolate; only craters
- Looks like the Moon
- Tidally locked
- No atmosphere => big temperature variation

### Venus

- May have had a ocean that evaporated due to runaway greenhouse effect
- Very hot

> [!abstract] runaway greenhouse effect
> Heat increases vapour concentration in atmosphere, which in turn traps more heat, finally leading to evaporation of oceans

### Mars

- Ice cap; may have had water flow in the past
- Thin atmosphere

## Asteroid belt

Belt of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter

## Jovian planets

- *Gaseous*
- All four have ring systems

### Jupiter

- Mostly helium
- Many moons

### Saturn

- Mostly helium
- Some moons create gaps in rings

### Uranus

- Mostly hydrogen compounds (water, methane, ammonia)

### Neptune

- Mostly hydrogen compounds

## Kuiper belt

Belt of large, icy objects outside of Neptune

### Pluto

[[Dwarf planet]]

- Much smaller than the other planets
- Icy, comet-like composition
- Elliptical, inclined orbit
- Orbit crosses that of Neptune

## Oort cloud

Cloud of comets
