# abiogenesis

Origin of [[life]] from inorganic compounds

## early Earth

- CO2, H2, N2, water vapor
- Reducing atmosphere (no oxygen)
- Electrically charged
- Hot
- Sun may be only 70% as hot

## abiotic synthesis

Spontaneous formation of small organic molecules from inorganic molecules

2 hypotheses:

- **Prebiotic (primordial) soup hypothesis**
	- Organic molecules formed in the atmosphere
	- Supported by Urey-Miller experiment that forms sugar, nucleotides and amino acids
	- Hydrogen cyanide may have formed amino acids
- **Iron-sulfur world hypothesis**
	- Organic molecules formed at hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor

## protocell

Origin of first cells

- Spontaneous assembly of macromolecules from small organic molecules
- Packaged into vesicles surrounded by [[membrane|phospholipid bilayer]]
	- Maintains homeostasis
- Information: may have RNA
- Metabolism: RNA because more catalytic than DNA, e.g. ribozymes
- Reproduction: **binary fission**

## early organisms

1. Anaerobic prokaryotic heterotroph feeding on prebiotic soup
2. Prokaryotic autotroph using photosynthesis and producing O2
3. Aerobic prokaryotic heterotroph capable of cellular respiration
4. Eukaryotic heterotroph (endosymbiosis with mitochondria)
5. Eukaryotic autotroph (endosymbiosis with chloroplast)

## oxygen revolution

Decline of anaerobes

- <= appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis
- => allows evolution of aerobes
- => allows more complex lifeforms

## formation of ozone layer

- UV forms O3 from O2 in the upper atmosphere
- O3 absorbs UV
- => decreases mutagenesis
- => enables living in surface waters and on land

## LUCA

Last common ancestor of all life on Earth

- Very similar to modern bacteria
- Likely autotrophic
- Likely chemotrophic
- Anaerobic
- Horizontal gene transfer likely
- Believed to have existed because:
	- All bacteria and archaea share ~30 genes
	- All organisms use the same amino acids
