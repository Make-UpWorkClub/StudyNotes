# abiogenesis

Origin of [[life]] from inorganic compounds

## early Earth

- CO2, H2, N2, water vapor
- Reducing atmosphere (no oxygen)
- Electrically charged
- Hot

## abiotic synthesis

Spontaneous formation of small organic molecules from inorganic molecules

2 hypotheses:

- **Prebiotic soup hypothesis**
	- Organic molecules formed in the atmosphere
	- Supported by Urey-Miller experiment that forms sugar, nucleotides and amino acids
- **Iron-sulfur world hypothesis**
	- Organic molecules formed at hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor

## protocell

Origin of first cells

- Spontaneous assembly of macromolecules from small organic molecules
- Packaged into vesicles surrounded by [[membrane|phospholipid bilayer]]
	- Maintains homeostasis
- Information: may have RNA
- Metabolism: RNA because more catalytic than DNA, e.g. ribozymes
- Reproduction: **binary fission**

## early organisms

1. Anaerobic prokaryotic heterotroph feeding on prebiotic soup
2. Prokaryotic autotroph using photosynthesis and producing O2
3. Aerobic prokaryotic heterotroph capable of cellular respiration
4. Eukaryotic heterotroph (endosymbiosis with mitochondria)
5. Eukaryotic autotroph (endosymbiosis with chloroplast)

## oxygen revolution

Allows evolution of aerobes

## formation of ozone layer

- UV forms O3 from O2 in the upper atmosphere
- O3 absorbs UV
- Decreases mutagenesis
- Enables living in surface waters and on land

## LUCA

Last common ancestor of all life on Earth
Very similar to modern bacteria
