Source of energy and molecules

> [!example] Photoheterotrophy: prokaryotes like green and purple non-sulfur bacteria

### Chemotrophy

#### Chemoautotrophy

Dependency on *chemical* energy and *inorganic* molecules

- Aerobic:
	- Sulfur oxidizer
	- Nitrificator
- Anaerobic:
	- Methanogen
	- Iron oxidizer
	- Sulphate reducer

#### Chemoheterotrophy

Dependency on *chemical* energy and *organic* molecules

### Phototrophy

#### Photoautotrophy

Dependency on *light* energy and *inorganic* molecules

#### Photoheterotrophy

Dependency on *light* energy and *organic* molecules from other organisms

- Mostly aerobic
- Includes consumers and decomposers
