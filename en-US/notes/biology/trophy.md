Source of energy and molecules

> [!example] Chemoautotrophy: prokaryotes like methanogen

> [!example] Photoheterotrophy: prokaryotes like green and purple non-sulfur bacteria

## Energy source

### Chemotrophy

Dependency on *chemical* energy

### Phototrophy

Dependency on *light* energy

## Carbon source

### Autotrophy

Dependency on *inorganic* energy and molecules

- Uses photosynthesis or chemosynthesis

### Heterotrophy

Dependency on *organic* energy and molecules from other organisms

- Mostly aerobic
- Includes consumers and decomposers
