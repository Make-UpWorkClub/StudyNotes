Source of energy and molecules

### Chemotrophy

#### Chemoautotrophy

Dependency on *chemical* energy and *inorganic* molecules
Use of inorganic molecules as electron donors

- Prokaryotes
	- Aerobic:
		- Sulfur oxidizer
		- Nitrificator
	- Anaerobic:
		- Methanogen
		- Iron oxidizer
		- Sulphate reducer

#### Chemoheterotrophy

Dependency on *chemical* energy and *organic* molecules

- Animals
- Fungi
- Protists
- Prokaryotes

### Phototrophy

#### Photoautotrophy

Dependency on *light* energy and *inorganic* molecules

- O2 produced:
	- Plants
	- Protists
	- Cyanobacteria
- O2 not produced:
	- Bacteria
		- Green and purple sulphur bacteria

#### Photoheterotrophy

Dependency on *light* energy and *organic* molecules from other organisms

- Mostly aerobic
- Includes consumers and decomposers
