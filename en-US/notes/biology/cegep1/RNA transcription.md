# RNA Transcription

Process in which [[nucleic acid#Deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]] makes [[nucleic acid#Ribonucleic acid|RNA]]

## Steps

### Initiation

1. **Transcription factors** help recruit RNA polymerase to gene.
2. [[polymerase#RNA polymerase|RNA polymerase]] binds to the promoter region upstream of gene and begins unwinding DNA.

> [!abstract] Promoter
> Region of DNA that includes the sequence `TATAAAA` in humans and start point

### Elongation

5' to 3' continuous RNA synthesis

### Termination

RNA polymerase transcribes the **terminator** region and unbinds from DNA.
