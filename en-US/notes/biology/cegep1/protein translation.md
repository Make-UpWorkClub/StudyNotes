# Protein Translation

Process in which [[nucleic acid#Ribonucleic acid|RNA]] makes [[protein]]

## Steps

### Initiation

1. Small ribosomal subunit binds to mRNA.
2. Initiator tRNA binds to mRNA.
3. Large ribosomal subunit binds to small subunit.
	- Requires GTP
	- Initiator tRNA positioned in P-site

### Elongation

**3' to 5'** protein synthesis

For each codon:

1. mRNA codon at A-site forms H-bonds with anticodon of tRNA.
	- GTP required
2. Peptide of tRNA in P-site binds to peptide of tRNA in A-site.
3. tRNA in A-site moves to P-site, P-site to E-site.
	- GTP required

### Termination

When the stop codon reaches A-site:

1. **Release factor** binds to stop codon
2. Bond between tRNA and polypeptide chain is hydrolyzed.
3. Ribosome dissociates.
