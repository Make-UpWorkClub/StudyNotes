# Polysaccharide

Family of [[carbohydrate]]
[[polymer|Polymer]] of [[monosaccharide|monosaccharides]] joined by **glycosidic linkage**

Formed by dehydration

## Members

### Starch

1-4 linkage of *$\alpha$* glucose monomers in the *same* orientation

Function: carbohydrate storage in *plants*

*Digestible* by most animals (possess digestive enzymes that can hydrolyse starch)

Forms:

- Amylose: *unbranched*
- Amylopectin: *somewhat branched*

### Cellulose

1-4 linkage of *$\beta$* glucose monomers in *alternating* orientation

Function: reinforces *cell walls of plants*

*Non digestible* by most animals (lack enzymes)
Cows have bacteria that can break down cellulose

*Unbranched*

### Glycogen

Function: carbohydrate storage in *liver and muscle*

*Branched*

### Chitin

Function: reinforces *cell walls of some fungi* and *the exoskeleton of some animals* (e.g. beetles, lobsters, crabs)
