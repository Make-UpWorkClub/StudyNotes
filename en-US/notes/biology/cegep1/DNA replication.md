# DNA Replication

Process during [[interphase#S|S phase]] in which [[nucleic acid#Deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]] makes a copy of itself
**Semiconservative** (one original strand is preserved in each copy)

## Enzymes

- **Helicase**: unwinds DNA strands by breaking H-bonds
- [[polymerase#Primase|Primase]]
- [[polymerase#DNA polymerase|DNA polymerase]]
- **Ligase**: repairs phosphodiester bonds

## Steps

### Initiation

1. Helicases bind to origins of replication and begin unwinding DNA to form a **replication bubble** with two **replication forks**, each fork with two strands.
2. Single-stranded binding proteins bind to the template DNA to keep them separated.

### Elongation

Synthesis of the complementary strands

Different for the two strands

#### Leading strand

*5' to 3' continuous* DNA synthesis in the *same* direction of DNA unwinding
*One* RNA primer

1. Primase makes a complementary RNA primer on the template strand.
2. DNA polymerase binds to RNA primer and synthesizes new strand.
3. DNA polymerase replaces RNA primer with DNA.
4. Ligase repairs link between replaced primer and rest of strand.

#### Lagging strand

*3' to 5' discontinuous* DNA synthesis in the *opposite* direction of DNA unwinding
*Many* RNA primers

1. Repeat many times:
	1. Primase makes a complementary RNA primer on the template strand.
	2. DNA polymerase binds to the RNA primer and synthesizes short strand called **Okazaki fragment**.
2. DNA polymerase replaces RNA primers with DNA.
3. Ligase repairs link between replaced primers and Okazaki fragments.

### Termination

In eukaryote DNA replication, removal of primer at beginning of lagging strand leaves a gap that cannot be filled by DNA polymerase.
=> shortening of [[telomere]] & deletion of genes => limits lifespan

> [!important] Not a problem for prokaryotes because they have circular DNA.
