# Ploidy

Number of complete sets of [[chromosome|chromosomes]] in a cell

Ploidy levels:

- 1 set: monoploidy
- 2 sets: **diploidy**
- 3+ sets: polyploidy

> [!abstract] Haploid
> Having the ploidy of a gamete, i.e. half that of a somatic cell

> [!abstract]+ Monoploid number
> Number of chromosomes in a single complete set of chromosomes
> `Sym.` x

> [!abstract]+ Haploid number
> Number of chromosomes in a gamete
> `Sym.` n
> = monoploid number in humans

> [!abstract]+ Chromosome number
> Number of chromosomes in a cell
> = ploidy * monoploid number

## Polyploidy

Usually due to errors in meiosis
Type of [[speciation]]

### Autopolyploidy

Acquisition of haploid set from the *same* species

> [!example] Two sperms fertilize the same egg.

> [!example] A sperm fertilizes a diploid egg.

### Allopolyploidy

Acquisition of haploid set from a *different* species

> [!example] Wheat

> [!example] White sturgeon
