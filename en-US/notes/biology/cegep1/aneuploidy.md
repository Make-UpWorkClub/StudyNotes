# Aneuploidy

Numerical [[chromosome abnormality]], i.e. atypical number of chromosomes

Frequency of aneuploid zygotes in human is 10-25%.

## Types

### Monosomy

One *less* chromosome (2n - 1)

Often *lethal*

> [!abstract] Turner syndrome: X0, phenotypically female, sterile

### Trisomy

One *more* chromosome (2n + 1)

Often *harmful*

> [!example] Down syndrome (trisomy 21): 3 21<sup>th</sup> chromosomes

> [!example] Klinefelter syndrome: XXY, often sterile, small testicles

> [!example] XYY syndrome: no syndrome

> [!example] Trisomy X: XXX, mostly no syndrome

> [!tip] Don't look up trisomy 13...
