# Endoplasmic Reticulum

Membrane-bound [[organelle]]
`Lit.` network within cytoplasm
`Abbr.` ER
Part of the [[endomembrane system]]

Continuous with [[plasma membrane]]

## Types

### Smooth

`Abbr.` SER
*Tubular* shape
*No* ribosome

Functions:

- [[lipid|Lipid]] synthesis
- [[carbohydrate|Carbohydrate]] metabolism
- Drug and poison detoxification
- $Ca^{2+}$ storage (in muscle cells)

### Rough

`Abbr.` RER
*[[cisterna|Cisternae]]* shape
*Has* ribosomes on its surface

Functions:

- Membrane production for the endomembrane system (incl. itself)
- Synthesis of proteins destined for insertion into the plasma membrane or secretion (by ribosomes)
- Packages proteins into transport [[vesicle|vesicles]] and sends them to the [[Golgi apparatus]]
