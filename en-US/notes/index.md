> Some features of Obsidian-Flavoured Markdown (the markup language I write my notes in) are not supported by Vitepress (the static site generator that powers this site), so a better way to read this site is to clone the repo and open with Obsidian:

> ```sh
> git clone https://github.com/Make-UpWorkClub/StudyNotes.git
