# Mean

Sum of measurements divided by the number of measurements
Measure of [[central tendency]]

Sample mean:

$$
\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{ i = 1 }^{ n } x_{i}}{n}
$$

Population mean:

$$
\mu = \frac{\sum_{ i = 1 }^{ N } x_i}{N}
$$

For discrete classes:

$$
\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{ i = 1 }^{ c } n_ix_i}{n}
$$

For continuous classes:

$$
\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{ i = 1 }^{ c } n_ic_i}{n}
$$
