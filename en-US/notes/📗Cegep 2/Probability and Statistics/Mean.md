# Mean

Sum of measurements divided by the number of measurements
Measure of [[central tendency]]

Sample mean:

$$
\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{ i = 1 }^{ n } x_{i}}{n}
$$

Population mean:

$$
\mu = \frac{\sum_{ i = 1 }^{ N } x_i}{N}
$$

For discrete classes:

$$
\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{ i = 1 }^{ c } n_ix_i}{n}
$$

For continuous classes:

$$
\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{ i = 1 }^{ c } n_ic_i}{n}
$$

For discrete random variable (`a.k.a.` **expected value**):

$$
\mu = E(X) = \sum xp(x)
$$

For linear transformation:

$$
E(Y) = E(aX + b) = aE(X) + b
$$

For sum / difference of **independent** variables:

$$
E(T) = E(X \pm Y) = E(X) \pm E(Y)
$$
