# Additive Rule

The [[Counting#^5d51c4|cardinality]] of an event that can occur through $k$ mutually exclusive events is

$$
n(A) = n(A_1) + n(A_2)\dots + n(A_k)
$$

## Additive rule of [[probability]]

The probability of an event that can occur through mutually exclusive events is

$$
P(A) = P(A_1) + P(A_2)
$$
