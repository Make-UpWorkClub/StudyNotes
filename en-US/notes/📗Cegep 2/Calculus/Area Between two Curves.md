# Area Between two Curves

Application of the [[definite integral]]

Let $f$ be the upper function and $g$ the lower function, then

$$
A = \int_{a}^{b} (f(x) - g(x)) \, \mathrm{d}x
$$

## Examples

> Find the equation of the area between $y = x^2$ and $y = 2x - x^2$.

$$
\begin{align}
A & = \int (x^2 - (2x - x^2)) \, \mathrm{d}x \\
 & = 2\int (x^2 - x) \, \mathrm{d}x \\
 & = \frac{2}{3}x^3 - x^2
\end{align}
$$
