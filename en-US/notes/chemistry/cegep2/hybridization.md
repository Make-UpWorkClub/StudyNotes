# Hybridization

Mixing of [[Orbital|orbitals]] to form new **hybrid orbitals**
Only occurs in the same [[Electron Shell|shell]]

## Types

Determined by electron pair arrangement

Steps to determine type of hybridization:

1. Draw Lewis structure
2. Determine electron arrangement
3. Deduce type of hybridization from electron arrangement

### $\ce{sp}$ hybridization

Formation of *2* hybrid orbitals between 1$s$ and *1*$p$ orbitals
Electron arrangement: *linear*

### $\ce{sp^2}$ hybridization

Formation of *3* hybrid orbitals between 1$s$ and *2*$p$ orbitals
Electron arrangement: *trigonal planar*

### $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridization

Formation of *4* hybrid orbitals between 1$s$ and *3*$p$ orbitals
Electron arrangement: *tetrahedral*

### $\ce{sp^3d}$ hybridization

Formation of *5* hybrid orbitals between 1$s$, *3*$p$ and *1*$d$ orbitals
Electron arrangement: *trigonal bipyramidal*

### $\ce{sp^3d^2}$ hybridization

Formation of *6* hybrid orbitals between 1 $s$, *3*$p$ and *2*$d$ orbitals
Electron arrangement: *octahedral*

## Bonds

*Single* bond -> 1 $\sigma$ bond ==with free rotation of atoms==
*Double* bond -> 1 $\sigma$ bond & *1* $\pi$ bond
*Triple* bond -> 1 $\sigma$ bond & *2* $\pi$ bonds

## Examples

> Determine the hybridization state of $\ce{CH_2O}$ and predict its molecular geometry.

Carbon: $\ce{sp^2}$ hybridization
Oxygen: $\ce{sp^2}$ hybridization
