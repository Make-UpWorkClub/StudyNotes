# Electromagnetic Radiation

[[Wave]] of the electromagnetic field
Form of energy
Exhibits wave-particle duality
`Abbr.` EMR

- Gamma ray
- X-ray
- Ultraviolet
- Visible light
- Infrared
- Microwave
- Radio wave

## Properties

### [[wave speed]]

$$
v = \frac{c}{n}
$$

Where $n$ is the **index of refraction** of the physical medium.

## Polarization

Property of an EMR that has the same direction of oscillation of the electric field

- Most natural light is unpolarized.
- Polarizing filter absorbs all but the light polarized parallel to the polarizer axis.
- The intensity of polarized EMR that passed through a polarizing filter is $$
I = I_0\cos^2\theta
$$
- The intensity of unpolarized EMR that passed through a polarizing filter is $$
I = \frac{1}{2}I_0
$$
