# Bohr Model

Atomic model where electrons orbit the nucleus
Incorrect for atoms other than hydrogen

Properties:

- Classical physics doesn't apply to atomic and subatomic particles.
- Electrons are limited to discrete [[energy level|energy levels]] each with its own energy and radius.
- Orbital circumference is a multiple of de Broglie wavelength:
  $$
  2\pi r = n\lambda
  $$
- The electrical force is the centripetal force:
  $$
  F_\text{elec} = \frac{mv^2}{r}
  $$
- The energy of the electron is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the proton-electron interaction:
  $$
  \begin{align}
  E_n & = K + U_\text{elec} \\
  E_{n H_2} & = -\frac{13.6}{n^2}\pu{eV}
  \end{align}
  $$
