## Resume

### Ch1

One day in February, at 5:30, Santiago Nasar woke up to see the bishop. He ate breakfast in the kitchen and went out through the front door at 6:00. Pedro and Pablo Vicario, sleeping on the bench, woke up and wanted to kill him, but Clotilde Armenta convinced them to wait for the bishop to pass. Santiago watched the bishop's boat pass, then went to change clothes at 6:25. Margot heard that they were going to kill Santiago, alerted Luisa Santiaga and went to warn Plácida, but Santiago was already killed.

### Ch2

In August of the year before, Bayardo San Román arrived at the town to find someone to marry. Toward the end of September, he met Angela Vicario. Six months later, their wedding took place. The night of the wedding, Bayardo returned Angela, discovering that she wasn't a virgin. Pura Vicario beat Angela. Angela revealed to the twins that it was Santiago Nasar who took her virginity.

### Ch3

At 3:00, the twins picked up two knives in the pigsty. Santiago and his friends left María Alejandrina Cervantes' place for Xius' house.
At 3:20, the twins asked Faustino Santos to sharpen them. The latter was informed about the murder and reported to Leandro Pornoy. The twins looked for Santiago Nasar at María Alejandrina Cervantes' place.
At 4:00, Leandro Pornoy reported to Colonel Lázaro Aponte.
At 4:10, the twins went to Clotilde Armenta's place.
At 4:20, Santiago returned home.
At 5:00, the colonel found the twins and disarmed them. They left, picked up another two knives, sharpened them at Faustino Santos' place, went to Prudencia Cotes' house for coffee, then returned.

### Ch4

In the afternoon, Father Carmen Amador performed autopsy on Santiago Nasar, whose body was completely destroyed. María Alejandrina Cervantes disappeared from the narrator's life because he smelled of Santiago. The twins were very sick in prison. Worried by vengeance by the Arabs, Colonel Aponte visited every family of Arabs and found no sign of vengeance. The Vicario family quietly moved to Manaure. Poncio and Pedro Vicario died. Prudencia Cotes married Pablo Vicario.

The mayor saved Bayardo San Román from alcool intoxication. His family brought him back.

Xius' farmhouse slowly crumbles. Angela became an embroiderer. She saw Bayardo at Hotel del Puerto and became crazy over him. She wrote a weekly letter for him for seventeen years. One August day, he visited Angela.

### Ch5

Various side characters suffered from Santiago's death. The magistrate found no evidence against Santiago Nasar.

Cristo was walking with Santiago along the dock when Yamil Shaium warned him about the murder. He searched for Santiago at his home, confronted the twins at Clotilde's store, and was on his way to the narrator's house when Santiago was killed.

Meanwhile, Santiago went into the house of his fiancée. Nahir Miguel warned him and offered him protection, but he left in confusion. Many people shouted at him, but he was disoriented. He saw the twins running toward him with knives and ran toward the front door of his house, but Placída shut the door, thinking he was upstairs. The twins stabbed him countless times against the door and ran away. In hallucination, Santiago got up, walked around holding his guts, and fell in his kitchen.
