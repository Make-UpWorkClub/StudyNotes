# Marriage in [[South Asia]]

## Arranged marriage

In India, **almost all marriages are arranged**.

Reasons:

- Importance of marriage
	- <= job, house and social circle gained through family connections
	- <= inability to divorce
		- `E.g.` military career dangerous thus undesirable
	- <= affects family reputation
- Experience of the parents
	- (Ridiculous since the marriage of the parents was most likely also arranged: the parents don't have more experience of choosing a partner.)
- Inexperience of the child being married
	- <= no date
	- <= no social life with the opposite sex
- Enjoyment of life without worrying about marriage
	- => no competition to be popular with the opposite sex
	- A.k.a. throwing all the burden on the parents?
- Mystery and romance of marriage
	- (???)

Factors:

- Family
	- Background
	- ~~Internal conflict~~
	- Number of children
		- The lesser the more ressource for each
- Caste
- Occupation
- Personality
	- ~~Independence~~
- Appearance
	- Skin colour
	- Height
	- Weight

## Endogamy

Marriage within a specific social group (caste) => prevents caste intermixing

## Dowry

Payment by a bride's family to her in-laws => degradation of women
Banned by law in India, but replaced by extensive gift exchanges => peak consumerism

## Divorce

Considered scandalous
Divorce ratio extremely low => enables abuse without consequence
