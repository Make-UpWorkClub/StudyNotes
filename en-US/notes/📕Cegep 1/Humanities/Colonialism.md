### Consequence of decolonization

The South-Asian states adopted the Westminster parliamentary system.
India inherited an *established* state structure. => more stable democracy
Sri Lanka and Nepal inherited a *weak* state structure.
Pakistan and Bangladesh had to *assemble* state structures.

The states attempted to draw support by invoking social values and local cultures and forming distinct identities.

The smaller states ally with larger powers outside of S.-A. => unstable regional relations
