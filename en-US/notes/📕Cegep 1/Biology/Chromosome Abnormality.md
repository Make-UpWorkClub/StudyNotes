# [[Chromosome]] Abnormality

Often occurs during crossing over in [[Meiosis|prophase I]]

## Structural abnormalities

### Deletion

Removal of genetic sequence

Often *harmful* <= *disrupts* gene balance
Lethal if embryo homozygous for large deletion or if occurring on X in male

### Duplication

Repetition of genetic sequence

Often *harmful* <= *disrupts* gene balance

### Inversion

Reversed orientation of genetic sequence

Usually *benign* <= *preserves* gene balance

### Translocation

Relocation of genetic sequence from one chromosome to another
May join a nonhomologous chromosome

Often *harmful* <= may *preserve or disrupt* gene balance

#### Reciprocal translocation

Exchange of segments between nonhomologous chromosomes

Usually *benign* <= *preserves* gene balance

#### Robertsonian translocation

Fusion of 2 nonhomologous chromosomes
Short arms often lost

Usually *harmless* <= *preserves* gene balance **because the short arms don't contain significant genetic material**
10-15% of child with Familial Down Syndrome (hereditary)
