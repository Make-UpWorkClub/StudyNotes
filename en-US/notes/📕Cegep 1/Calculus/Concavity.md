# Concavity

Property of a function over an interval $I$ where $\forall x \in I,\ f''(x) > 0$ (**up**) or $f''(x) < 0$ (**down**)
2<sup>nd</sup> degree of [[Monotonicity]]

In a concave *up / down* function:

- Any tangent line is *below / up*.
- Its derivative is always *increasing* or *decreasing*.

## Evaluation

To find the intervals of concavity:

1. Find the domain of $f$.
2. Find and simplify $f''$.
3. Find all inflection points of $f$.
4. Construct a sign table with the inflection points.
