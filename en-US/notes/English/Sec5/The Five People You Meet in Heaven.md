### Arrival

Eddie arrives at Ruby Pier of his childhood and sees the Blue Man.

### The First Person Eddie Meets in Heaven

The Blue Man explains to Eddie that he’s in heaven, which is for understanding one’s life on earth, and he will meet five people who are significant to his life. Then he reveals that Eddie killed him.

> [!quote] 7th Birthday
> Eddie’s baseball flies into a clearing when he’s playing with Joe. Joe is scared by the sideshow actors and runs away while Eddie is not afraid and gets the ball.

The Blue Man tells his story. He was nervous as a child. Once, when working in a factory with his father, he dropped a sack of buttons and was humiliated by the workers. After that, his father refused to speak to him. Seeking medicine for his nerves, he drank a lot of $AgNO_{3(aq)}$, which turned his skin blue. Because of this, he lost his job. But then, he was found by the carnival men at Ruby Pier and worked there. He appreciated his new job because it gave him freedom. However, one day when he was driving, he got a heart attack from Eddie crossing the street to get his baseball and died.

> [!quote] 8th Birthday
> Eddie doesn’t get a birthday party because he has to attend the Blue Man’s funeral.

### The First Lesson

> Nothing happened lmao

> Joe reveals to the family that Eddie has a girlfriend. Eddie is upset and the two get into a fight. Eddie’s mother reconciles them by making them dance.

### The Second Person Eddie Meets in Heaven

Eddie meets the Captain, his commanding officer when he fought in the Philippines. He is reminded of when his group was taken prisoner, tortured and forced to work in a coal mine. But he was able to distract the guards by juggling and kill them with a coordinated attack.

> [!quote] 21st Birthday (?)
> Eddie celebrates his birthday with Marguerite just before going to the war.

The freed soldiers were burning the enemy base when Eddie thought he saw a small figure running inside the fire. He wanted to save them, but the Captain knew he wouldn’t come out alive, so he shot him in the leg. Then, the four soldiers drove to a gate. The Captain opened the gate and checked the path but was split into pieces by a land mine.

### The Second Lesson

The Captain tells Eddie that sacrifice is a part of life and it’s an honourable act.

> In the hospital, Eddie’s mother, Joe, Marguerite and Mickey celebrate Eddie’s birthday, but Eddie’s father neglects him.

Damages done by Eddie’s father:

- Neglect: as a child, Eddie wants his father’s attention, but is neglected by him. He often offers help at his father’s work, but the only job he gets is to collect fallen coins.
- Violence: his father gambles and drinks alcohol. When he gets angry, he often unleashes his anger on his kids.
- Silence: after Eddie stands up against his violence, he refuses to talk to him ever again.

Eddie meets Ruby and learns that she met her husband at this diner (Seahorse Grill). Then, he built Ruby Pier for her.

> [!quote] 37th Birthday
> Eddie and Noel discuss about an amusement park accident in Brighton. After, they go to the horse track.

### The Third Lesson

Eddie learns that when Mickey was fired because of his drinking problem, he tried to rape Eddie’s mother, but Eddie’s father chased him with a hammer. Then, he attempted to drown himself in the sea, but Eddie’s father saved him and consequently got pneumonia. Eddie also learns that his father died in guilt by slumping halfway out the window on a chilly night. Ruby reveals that his husband was in the same hospital room and that’s how she knew about Eddie’s family. Finally, Ruby convinces Eddie to forgive his father and let go of the pain.
