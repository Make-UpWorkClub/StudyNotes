# shell model

Model of the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]
Similar to Bohr's atomic model

- Protons and neutrons occupy shells (energy states).
- Lowest energy states are filled first.
- Low atomic number: similar energies for protons and neutrons
- High atomic number: more neutrons => neutrons can have lower energies than protons
