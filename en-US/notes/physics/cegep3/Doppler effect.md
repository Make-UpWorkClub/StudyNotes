# Doppler effect

When a [[wave]] source / observer is moving, the perceived frequency is affected.

$$
f' = \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s}f
$$

> [!example] Receding light source is red shifted, approaching light source is blue shifted.

## Examples

> Standing at a crosswalk, you hear a frequency of 560 Hz from the siren of an approaching ambulance. After the ambulance passes, you hear the frequency of the siren as 480 Hz. Determine the ambulanceâ€™s speed from these observations. Use the speed of sound for normal air conditions.

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{cases}
f' & = 560 = \frac{v}{v - v_s}f \\
f'' & = 480 = \frac{v}{v + v_s}f
\end{cases} \\
 \\
f = \frac{560(v - v_s)}{v} & = \frac{480(v + v_s)}{v} \\
560v - 560v_s & = 480v + 480v_s \\
v_s & = \frac{1}{13}v \approx 26.4\pu{m/s}
\end{align}
