# thermal conduction

Mechanism of [[heat]] transfer through *contact*

$$
P = kA \frac{\Delta T}{L} = kA \frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}x}
$$

- $k$: thermal conductivity of the material
- $A$: area of cross section
- $L$: length of material

## Examples

> You are boiling pasta and absentmindedly grab a copper spoon rather than your wooden spoon. The copper spoon has a 20 mm × 1.5 mm rectangular cross section, and the distance from the boiling water to your 35℃ hand is 18 cm. How long does it take the spoon to transfer 25 J of energy to your hand?

$$
\begin{align}
P & = kA \frac{\Delta T}{L} \\
 & = 400(0.02 \cdot 0.0015) \frac{100 - 35}{0.18} \\
 & \approx 4.3333\pu{W} \\
 \\
W & = \frac{E}{t} \\
4.3333 & = \frac{25}{t} \\
t & \approx 5.7692\pu{s}
\end{align}
$$
