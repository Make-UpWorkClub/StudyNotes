# energy balance

Relationship between [[énergie|energy]] absorbed and energy emitted by an object

$$
\begin{align}
P_\text{in} & = S_0(1 - \alpha)\pi R^2_\text{Earth} \\
P_\text{out} & =
\end{align}
$$

The solar irradiance is the intensity of solar radiation at the Earth's position:

$$
S_0 = 1362\pu{W/m^2}
$$
