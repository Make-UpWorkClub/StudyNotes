# nuclear decay

Process by which an unstable [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] tries to achieve a more stable configuration by emitting radiation
=> lower [[nuclear binding energy]]

$$
N(t) = N_0e^{-rt}
$$

> [!abstract] decay series
> Series of [[isotope|isotopes]] from the unstable isotope to the stable isotope

## Types

### Alpha

Emission of a *helium*

$$
\alpha: \ce{_Z^AX -> _{Z - 2}^{A - 4}Y + _2^4He}
$$

### Beta

#### Plus

Emission of a *positron* and a *[[neutrino]]* to transform a *proton* into a lower energy *neutron*

$$
\beta^+: \ce{_Z^AX -> _{Z - 1}^AY + e^+ + {v}}
$$

#### Minus

Emission of an *electron* and an *antineutrino* to transform a *neutron* into a lower energy *proton*

$$
\beta^-: \ce{_Z^AX -> _{Z + 1}^AY + e^- + \bar{v}}
$$

### Gamma

Emission of a high-energy *[[photon]]*

- Typically happens with alpha or beta decay

$$
\gamma: \ce{_Z^AX^* -> _Z^AX + \gamma}
$$
