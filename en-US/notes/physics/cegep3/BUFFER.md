Travelling disturbance that carries energy without transfer of mass

> [!abstract] wave pulse
> Single disturbance, e.g. one jerk of a rope

> [!abstract] periodic wave
> Continuous stream of pulses

## Types

- Mechanical
- Electromagnetic
- Gravitational
- Matter

### Mechanical

Propagates through a physical medium

### Electromagnetic

Propagate through the electromagnetic field

## Direction

**Transverse**: motion of medium *perpendicular* to direction of propagation
**Longitudinal**: motion of medium *parallel* to the direction of propagation

## Representation

**Snapshot**: displacement as a function of *position* at a given *moment in time*
**History graph**: displacement as a function of *time* at a given *point in space*
