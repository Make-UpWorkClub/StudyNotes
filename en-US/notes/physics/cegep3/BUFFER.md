# oscillatory motion

Periodic back and forth motion
Caused by a restoring force (directed towards equilibrium)

# simple harmonic motion

[[Oscillatory motion]] whose restoring force is directly proportional to displacement
Sinusoidal

x(t) & = A\cos\left( \omega t + \phi_0 \right) \\
\omega & = \frac{2\pi}{T} \\
F & = -kx
