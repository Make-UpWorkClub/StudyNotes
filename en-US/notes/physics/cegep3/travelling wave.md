# travelling wave

[[Wave]] that travels
`Ant.` [[standing wave]]

[[Interference]] of two **identical** travelling waves:

$$
y(x, t) = \underbrace{2A\cos\left( \frac{\Delta\phi}{2} \right)}_{\text{Amplitude component}}\underbrace{\sin(kx_{avg} \pm \omega t + (\phi_0)_{avg})}_{\text{Traveling component}}
$$

- $\Delta x$ is the difference between distance travelled.
- $\Delta t$ is the time delay.
- $\Delta\phi_0$ is the intrinsic phase difference (phase difference between the waves at emission).
