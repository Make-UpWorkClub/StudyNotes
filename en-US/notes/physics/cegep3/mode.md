# mode

Pattern of motion of a [[periodic wave]]
`Sym.` $m$

- Each mode has a unique frequency $f_m$ and wavelength $\lambda_m$.
- For a [[standing wave]], corresponds to the number of antinodes.

## Fundamental mode

Mode with the lowest [[en-US/notes/physics/frequency#Fundamental frequency|fundamental frequency]]

\lambda_1 = 2L
