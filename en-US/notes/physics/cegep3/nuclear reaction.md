# nuclear reaction

Reaction between multiple atoms that changes the mass number

## Types

### Nuclear fusion

*Combination* of two or more nuclei

- <= very high density and temperature overcome the electric repulsion between nuclei.
- Tends to happen to atoms with mass number < 60
- Occurs in stars

### Nuclear fission

*Separation* into two or more nuclei

- <= approach of a ==slow== neutron
- Tends to happen to atoms with mass number > 60
- Rapid growth of fission events
- Hard to control
