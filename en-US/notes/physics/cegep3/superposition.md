# superposition

When two or more [[wave|waves]] are simultaneously present at a single point in space, the displacement of the medium at that point is the sum of the displacements due to each wave.

## Interference

**Constructive**: superposition resulting in *increased* amplitude
**Destructive**: superposition resulting in *decreased* amplitude
