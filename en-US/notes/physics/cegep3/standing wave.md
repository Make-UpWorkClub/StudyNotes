# standing wave

[[Wave]] resulting from the [[interference]] of two **identical** waves travelling in the opposite direction
`Ant.` [[travelling wave]]

> [!abstract] boundary condition
> Condition of the ends of the medium that allows the creation of a standing wave

## Mechanical wave on a string

Boundary condition: reflection at the fixed ends => the ends must be *nodes* 

$$
y(x, t) = \underbrace{2A\sin(kx)}_{\text{Amplitude component}}\underbrace{\cos(\omega t)}_{\text{Oscillating component}}
$$

## Sound wave in a tube

Boundary condition: reflection at closed ends => the ends must be *nodes*
Boundary condition: balance of internal and external pressure at open ends => the ends must be *antinodes*

### Closed-closed

`Abbr.` C-C

### Open-open

`Abbr.` O-O

### Open-closed

`Abbr.` O-C
