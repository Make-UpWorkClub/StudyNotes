# standing wave

[[Wave]] resulting from two identical waves travelling in the opposite direction
On a string, reflection at the end of the string causes the identical wave to travel in the opposite direction.

$$
y(x, t) = 2A\sin(kx)\cos(\omega t)
$$

> [!abstract] node
> Locations where displacement is always zero

> [!abstract] antinode
> Locations where displacement is maximal

> [!abstract] boundary condition
> On a fixed string, the ends must be nodes.
