# wave speed

Travelled distance of a [[wave]] per time
**Property of the medium** (determined by the restoring force and the inertia)

$$
\begin{align}
v & = \sqrt{\frac{F_\text{restoring}}{I}} \\
v & = \frac{\lambda}{T} \\
v & = \lambda f
\end{align}
$$

For a wave propagating along a string under tension:

$$
\begin{align}
v & = \sqrt{\frac{T_s}{\mu}} \\
\mu & = \frac{m}{l}
\end{align}
$$

Where $\mu$ is the **linear density** in kg/m.
