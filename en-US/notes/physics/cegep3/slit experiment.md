# slit experiment

Passing light through slits to observe the effect of [[diffraction]] and [[interference]]

## Single slit

Pattern: wide **central maximum** with progressively narrower maxima

$$
\begin{align}
a\sin\theta_\text{dark} & = m\lambda \\
y & = L\tan\theta \approx L\sin\theta \text{ (S.A.A.)}
\end{align}
$$

> [!info] For a single obstacle, the diffraction pattern is the same as for a single slit.

## Double slit

Pattern: like single slit but with fringes

$$
\begin{align}
d\sin\theta & = m\lambda
\end{align}
$$

## Slit grating

## Examples

> Light of wavelength 587.5 nm illuminates a single slit 0.750 mm in width.

> 1. At what distance from the slit should a screen be located if the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is to be 0.850 mm from the center of the principal maximum?

$$
\begin{align}
y & = L\tan\theta \approx L\sin\theta \text{ (S.A.A.)} \\
\frac{0.850}{L} & = \sin\theta \\
 \\
a\sin\theta_\text{dark} & = m\lambda \\
0.750 \frac{0.850}{L} & = 587.5 \\
L & \approx 1.09\pu{m}
\end{align}
$$

> 2. What is the width of the central maximum?

$$
2y = 2 \cdot 0.850 = 1.7\pu{mm}
$$
