# wave

Travelling [[oscillatory motion|oscillating]] disturbance that carries energy without transfer of mass

![[Onde.png|300]]

> [!abstract] wave pulse
> Single disturbance, e.g. one jerk of a rope

## Types

### By medium

- Mechanical: propagates through a physical medium
	- `E.g.` sound, ocean wave
- Electromagnetic
- Gravitational
- Matter

### By direction

- **Transverse**: motion of medium *perpendicular* to direction of propagation
- **Longitudinal**: motion of medium *parallel* to the direction of propagation
- Combination of transverse and longitudinal
	- `E.g.` surface wave

## Representation

- **Snapshot**: displacement as a function of *position* at a given *moment in time*
- **History graph**: displacement as a function of *time* at a given *point in space*
- **3D**: both time and space

> The leading edge is in the direction of the wave in snapshot.
> The leading edge always comes first (left) in history graph.
> => the snapshot and the history graph are reversed for a wave going right.
