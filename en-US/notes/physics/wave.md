# wave

Travelling [[oscillatory motion|oscillating]] disturbance that carries energy without transfer of mass

> [!abstract] wave pulse
> Single disturbance, e.g. one jerk of a rope

> [!abstract] periodic wave
> Continuous stream of pulses

## Properties

![[Onde.png|300]]

### Wavelength

Distance between two successive identical points
`Sym.` $\lambda$

### Amplitude

Maximum displacement of particles
`Sym.` $A$

### Frequency

Number of peaks that pass through a point in one second
`Ant.` period

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

### Period

Time taken for one peak to pass through a point
`Ant.` frequency

$$
T = \frac{1}{f}
$$

### Speed

Travelled distance per time
**Property of the medium** (determined by the restoring force and the inertia)

$$
\begin{align}
v & = \sqrt{\frac{F_\text{restoring}}{I}} \\
v & = \frac{\lambda}{T} \\
v & = \lambda f
\end{align}
$$

For a wave propagating along a string under tension:

$$
\begin{align}
v & = \sqrt{\frac{T_s}{\mu}} \\
\mu & = \frac{m}{l}
\end{align}
$$

Where $\mu$ is the **linear density** in kg/m.

> [!warning] Wave speed != speed of particle

### Direction

**Transverse**: motion of medium *perpendicular* to direction of propagation
**Longitudinal**: motion of medium *parallel* to the direction of propagation

## Types

- Mechanical
- Electromagnetic
- Gravitational
- Matter

### Mechanical

Propagates through *a physical medium*

> [!example] Sound, ocean wave

### Electromagnetic

Propagate through *the electromagnetic field*

> [!example] Light, radio

## Representation

**Snapshot**: displacement as a function of *position* at a given *moment in time*
**History graph**: displacement as a function of *time* at a given *point in space*
**3D**: both time and space

> The leading edge always comes first (left) in history graph.
