# wave

Travelling [[oscillatory motion|oscillating]] disturbance that carries energy without transfer of mass

> [!abstract] wave pulse
> Single disturbance, e.g. one jerk of a rope

## Properties

![[Onde.png|300]]

### amplitude

Maximum displacement of particles
`Sym.` $A$

### period

Time taken for one peak to pass through a point
`Ant.` frequency

$$
T = \frac{1}{f}
$$

### wave direction

**Transverse**: motion of medium *perpendicular* to direction of propagation
**Longitudinal**: motion of medium *parallel* to the direction of propagation

## Types

- Mechanical: propagates through a physical medium
  > [!example] Sound, ocean wave
- Electromagnetic
- Gravitational
- Matter

## Representation

**Snapshot**: displacement as a function of *position* at a given *moment in time*
**History graph**: displacement as a function of *time* at a given *point in space*
**3D**: both time and space
