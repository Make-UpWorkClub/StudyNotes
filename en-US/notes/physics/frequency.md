# frequency

Number of peaks that pass through a point on a [[wave]] 's path in one second
`Ant.` period

$$
\begin{align}
f & = \frac{1}{T} \\
f_m & = mf_1
\end{align}
$$

## Fundamental frequency

Lowest frequency of a periodic signal
`Syn.` 1<sup>st</sup> harmonic

$$
\begin{align}
f_1 & = \frac{v}{2L} \\
f_1 & = \Delta f  = f_{m + 1} - f_m
\end{align}
$$
